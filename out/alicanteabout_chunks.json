In this area, there is also a terrace for smokers in the Budweiser pub. The area reserved for non-EU international flights (to the UK, Morroco, etc) has a smaller restaurant and shop offer.\nSecurity is usually fast with several lines opening and closing depending on the passenger’s load.

There is a bus to Alicante (line C-6) , a taxi stop, private transfers and a coach/bus station for commutes to Benidorm , Altea and many other destinations. You can not order Uber or Cabify from Alicante airport but taxis are available and waiting in the terminal.\nAlicante Nightlife\nAlicante is good for partying too. It has a vivid nightlife cheered by people of all ages. The party is divided into 4 main areas:\nOld Quarter El Barrio\nThe main party area in Alicante with the most clubs. A bit of everything, from Latin music to techno not forgetting commercial Spanish music, commercial international music, reggaeton, rock and more. Clubs close at 3 am by law.\nCastaños\nPerfect for joining up on the Tardeo phenomenon. The Spanish usually start partying late. It is common to meet your friends for dinner at 10 pm and then go to a club from 11 pm-12 am up to 3 am or more moving to after-hours clubs.\nIn Castaños, people would meet earlier for a drink, from 5 pm or so, which is not that common in Spain. In that street, clubs open earlier than in the Old Quarter so you can be partying from 5-6 pm and go home earlier after a nice party evening.\nClubs will open in the evening and close at 3 am too.\nPuerto\nPuerto (means port or harbour) is in between El Postiguet Beach and Alicante’s marina, close by the “The Ocean Race” museum .\nAt Puerto , some of the clubs will close later than 3 am so it is a good place to go after a party at the Old Quarter or Castaños. There are different places with different music styles, including Latin music , and even a karaoke bar.\nPlaya de San Juan (Summer)\nPlaya de San Juan also has some pubs and clubs but the season when more people would party in this part of Alicante is summer.\nEl Golf (Summer)\nNext to the golf field “Alicante Golf” there are some clubs that get busy during summer. You can go by TRAM lines 1 and 3 getting off at “ Campo de Golf ” which usually offers night service during the summer weekends.\nAlicante Gastronomy\nAlicante is rich in traditional gastronomy. Here are some examples of foods that you should try when in Alicante:\nArroz Alicantino: A Banda, arroz del señorito, arroz con costra, con bogavante, del señoret and other variants\nCoca de Mollitas\nTurrones de Jijona\nOlleta Alicantina\nCoca de San Juan/Coca amb Tonyina\nAlicante FAQs\nWhat is the Heat Like in Alicante during Summer?\nTemperatures during summer can be a bit suffocating if you are not used to it. It is not common to have more than 35ºC during the day but possible. At night, it goes down to around 20ºC in the very early morning but most flats don’t have enough time to cool down. The Mediterranean Sea makes sure the humidity is high all day and night every day. Having A/C where you are staying is the safest bet if you don’t have experience with heat. Fans and dehumidifiers can help too. Keep in mind isolation in flats is not the best in older buildings.\nHow safe is Alicante?\nAlicante is a safe city. There are 29 offences for every 1000 inhabitants. In comparison, Barcelona has 47.8 offences for every 1000 inhabitants and Madrid has 37. Malaga is just a bit safer with 25.8 per 1000 people. The data is from 2022 and was gathered from this press article (in Spanish) .\nWhich Areas I Should Avoid When Considering Flats?\nAlicante is generally a safe city but there are some neighbourhoods that are generally less safe than others. Generally speaking, avoid this neighbourhood if you don’t know what you are doing:\n– Virgen del Remedio\n– Colonia Requena\n– Juan XIII\n– Cuatrocientas Viviendas\nDo You Need Cash in Alicante?\nIt is possible to pay by card in TRAMs , Buses , Airport Buses and Taxis .\nBig grocery stores such as Mercadona or Carrefour accept card payments too.\nMost small stores, bakeries, cigarette shops, bars and restaurants get payment cards as well.\nOnly a small percentage of small stores, bars, restaurants and clubs will accept cash-only payments .\nThe recommendation is to have a small amount of cash with you , apart from your cards, for the odd place where you can only pay in cash.\nRemember Alicante’s currency is Euros (€) .\nWhat are the Most Popular English-speaking Radio Stations in Alicante?\n– Fig FM – online on bigradiospain.com/big-fm or in their Apps\n– BR2 Pure Gold Radio on bigradiospain.com/br2puregoldradio or in their Apps\n– TKO – online on tko.radio or in Alexa and their Apps\n– Bay Radio – online on bayradio.fm or in Alexa\nHow to Find a House/Flat/Room in Alicante?\nTry visiting several real estate websites:\n– idealista.com\nThe rental agreement usually requires the first and last month’s rent equivalent and the security deposit. If you found the flat using an agent then add one more month’s rent equivalent to the agent’s fee.\nIs there an Hourly Rental car Company in Alicante?\nIt is very easy to rent a car in Alicante but, sadly, there is no service such as Zipcar.com, share-now.com or Hiyacar.co.uk where you can book a car from an app and drive it just for a few hours, without going to a rental company office first.\nBut car rental prices in Alicante are economical. A few example companies that would allow you to rent a car for a day with low fees are Centauro.net, wiberrentacar.com and drivalia.es.\nA few years ago, a company called Mooving used the hourly/minutes rental system with an app for electric mopeds but went bankrupt during the 2020 pandemic after leaving Alicante a few months earlier."

    "content_text": "During Las Hogueras de San Juan -or The Bonfires of Saint John- everyone is welcome to celebrate a particular Midsummer-originated festival with unusual events and activities.\nMounting a Hoguera in Alicante\nLas Hogueras de San Juan -The Bonfires of Saint John- is a festival in Alicante celebrated with gigantic bonfires made of satirical sculptures , party, gunpowder crackers, water, music, traditions, food and sun. On the 19th of June, the bonfires are mounted and on the night of the 24th, burned.\nHogueras 2024 Schedule\nAlicante Tram 2024 Schedule\nThere is a lot to know about the bonfire festival, celebrated following history and traditions but also with many parties.\nContents\nToggle\nThe Bonfires\nThe main attraction of Las Hogueras (or Les Foguers in Valenciano ) -The Bonfires- is the actual bonfires.\nIn Alicante, the hogueras are satiric sculptures made of flammable material. It is usually a mix of wood, white cork, cardboard and other materials that can be easily burned.\nA big Hoguera in Alicante as tall as several floors\nThere are hundreds of bonfires distributed around the city -not only in the city centre-. Each Hoguera has its own central theme and several sub-themes in the smaller figures and dioramas. The topics can be politics, current affairs -such as wars or global warming- or health to name a few examples. The art communication approach is usually satirical.\nThe Hogueras are paid by neighbours associated with Barracas or Racos (more of this below) except for the Bonfire in the city hall – Hoguera Oficial – that is paid using taxpayers’ funds.\n@alicanteabout The #hogueras festival in #alicante happens every year from the 19th to the 24th of June. Big monuments are burned the last night from the 24th to the 25th. But there is way more about Hogueras. Drop me a message or go to Https://alicanteabout.com/hogueras to learn more! #hogueras #hogueras2024 #alicante #tiktokpoll ♬ original sound – AlicanteAbout.com\nHogueras Infantiles\nThe Hogueras Infantiles -children’s bonfires- are the smaller bonfires near the main ones. Each barraca or raco (neighbours associations) have to build a hoguera for the children too.\nChildren’s Bonfire in Florida Neighbourhood\nThis is a great way to involve the youngsters in the festivity as the associations have also a figure called Bellea -beauty- and the Bellea Infantil -or children’s beauty- that have a key role in the traditions, for example, bringing the spark that will burn the bonfire on the last day of the festival. More of this is below.\nOn the last day of the festival, the bonfires are burned by the firefighters in an event called La Banya and -again- more of this is below.\nHogueras Categories\nEach Hoguera monument is in a category based on the budget and other characteristics. The most impressive bonfires can be as tall as a 3 or 4-floor building and they are Categoria Especial or special category.\nThere are usually 6 categories plus the special, so 7 in total. They compete with the other monuments in their categories. The Hoguera at the city hall is paid with taxpayers’ money and it is as big as a Hoguera Especial but does not participate in the contest.\nThe following photo is an example of a special category hoguera :\nSpecial category Hoguera in Alicante\nVersus an example of another adult hoguera of the 5th category:\nHoguera in the 5th category in Alicante\nIt is clear the size difference, hence the creation costs are different too and the category follows the same logic.\nOn the 20th of June, all hogueras must finish the mounting – la planta – and on the 22nd of June, the prizes are given.\nBanner with the prizes achieved by a Hoguera in Alicante\nAs you can understand from the picture above, each hoguera comettee compites in different prizes: the best hoguera (arguably the most important prize), the satirical critics in the monuments, the best children’s hogueras or the best street illumination to name a few.\nThe city hall runs a bus to visit all the categoria especial hogueras during the festivity week that is free. Some stops are a few minutes away from the hoguera while others are very close to it.\nBarracas , Racos and La Fiesta\nHogueras are about the party , so next to each hoguera monument, there is a Barraca or Raco , which are similar and both are generally called Barraca .\nBoth of them are in the middle of the streets. The roads get closed to cars so members can sit at tables with their friends for food and drinks, dance to DJ or band music and enjoy the festivities together.\nEntrance to a Barraca Durng Hogueras Alicante\nThe difference between barracas and racos is the type of membership to the hoguera association. While barraca’s members participate in all-year-round hogueras’ events and decisions, the raco’s members join the party only during the main days 19-24 of June.\nAlso, many barracas are fenced and the access is somehow protected while racos are open to anyone joining the dance floor -but not the table as you and your friends need to pay a table’s renting fee-.\nTo add more confusion, not all racos have dining tables so they are essentially music clubs.\nFree entrance raco in Alicante Hogueras\nBarracas also have beautiful and artistic entrances that get also burned on the last night of Hogueras .\nSo Where is La Fiesta During Hogueras?\nLa Fiesta happens all around Alicante. Roads are closed to cars so racos and barracas pop up literally all around the city. The centre is where a bigger concentration of fiesta in barracas and racos happens.\nWe earlier said the racos are open to anyone. There are several racos with permission from the city hall to be open to anyone in Alicante but a few can charge a ticket fee to enter.\nFor example, in Avenida de Federico Soto , there is -usually- an open to all raco with pachanga -a commonly heard Spanish music at festivals-. If you like drum and bass the raco in front of Bomberos plays this type of music all night.\nLas Mascletas\nA mascleta is 5:30 to 7 minutes -mainly- sound spectacle based on loud pyrotechnic crakers. In Alicante, there is a show every day at 2 pm at Plaza de los Luceros during Hogueras . The different pyrotechnics companies compete in a contest that values the amount and types of crackers and rhythms on the firing, among other characteristics.\nMascletas can be very loud, and some flying crackers can be heard miles away from Luceros . Streets around the plaza gets usually very busy during the spectacle and it is quite loud. For the newer people, it can be a bit overwhelming, especially when the wind brings the powder smoke to you.\nIf it is going to be your first mascleta and you are a bit sensitive to noise the best is to watch and hear it from afar. A good place to watch the mascleta where it is less overwhelming is on Escaleras de Jorge Juan .\nMascleta From Escaleras del Jorge Juan\nLa Crema and la Palmera\nOn the last night of the festivity, on the 24th of June, when the burning of the bonfires takes place. This is called La Crema or “the burning”.\nThe Crema officially starts at 12 am on the 24th, so the night from the 24th to the 25th . A firework from Santa Barbara Castle with the shape of a palm tree gives the official start to la Crema .\nPalm Tree Starting the Burning of the Hogueras -From Mercado Tram Station –\nThis moment creates expectations. People usually find a spot where the palmera can be seen. Hundreds of people will group around places such as Mercado , Jorge Juan or Postiguet Beach to watch it so they have a clear and direct view of Castillo de Santa Barbara . La Palmera is a special and meaningful event: a gigantic -and beautiful- palm tree growing from Santa Barbara Castle which is the beginning of the end of the Hogueras Festival.\nHave in mind this ephemeral symbol that gives the green light to the burning of the Hogueras . The palm tree itself last for about 15 seconds.\nLa Crema -The Burning-\nLa Crema happens the night of the 24th to the 25th of June.\nThe first hogueras to be burned are the Hoguera Oficial in Alicante’s city hall square and some other hogueras in the city center.\nCrema of Bonfire in Hogueras Festival Alicante\nAll the hogueras burnings are controlled by the firefighters. Until they are ready the burning is not provoked. The hoguera committee prepares the burning with petrol and a trac a or string of firecrackers that is ignited by the Bellea , more about Belleas is below.\nFirefighters controlling the burning of the Hoguera\nThe children’s bonfires or hogueras infantiles might be burned without firefighters supervision at a different time as they are way smaller.\nThere are usually 3 turns for the burning depending on the Hoguera category and location. The schedule released is based on best effort and it is common to wait to see the burning due to delays. Safety first.\nLa Banya\nThis is a tradition happening during the Crema .\nHogueras can be big and June in Alicante is warm; even at midnight. The firefighters -after being sure the burning is safe- help spectators to cold down throwing them water directly from the truck’s hoses.\nChildren, teens and adults enjoying the banya\nIn this tradition participates people of all ages, from young children to teenagers to adults. If you join the celebration, you will end up soaked in water at the end of the crema… then you can just walk to the next burning bonfire and repeat the process for a few hours.\nIt is of Alicantinian expertise to manage the burning times of different hogueras -remember the firefighters burn first the official and central bonfires- to go from one banya to another limiting waiting time and travel distance, especially when you are young.\nLas Belleas\nLas Belleas -or the beauties- are girls and women that officially represent each raco commission. There are different acts throughout the year where a bellea is chosen -in between each hogueras committee- to represent the Hogueras festival in the city and hold the title of Bellesa del Foc or Fire’s beauty. There are two belleas every year, the bellea infantil -or children’s bellea – and the adult bellea .\nBelleas at Hoguera Oficial in Allicante’s city hall mounting\nThere are also other girls that escort the Bellea to different acts. They are called Damas de Honor as they were not chosen as Bellesa del Foc but still participate in many representative acts.\nAll belleas of each hoguera committee have different tasks, being one of the most dramatic the ignition of the fire that will burn the bonfire on the last night of the festivity.\nThe chosen adult bellea that represents all hogueras is called Bellea del Foc -or fire’s beauty- and has many other functions such as giving the green light for starting the mascletas or participating in the desperta -a brass band playing traditional music while parading around Alicante’s streets to awaking the neighbours so they can join the party early-.\nBelleas usually dress in traditional Alicantinian dresses. You can take a look at them on the hoguera’s website .\nTransport and Public Transport During Hogueras\nDuring the Hogueras week -7am on the 18th of June until the 24th of June-, the city centre is closed to car traffic. Only emergency vehicles and residents can drive through some areas and streets.\nThe area of Alicante closed to traffic during Hogueras is in yellow\nThe bus service can’t circulate in most of the city centre either, only TRAM still operates in the underground station at Mercado and Luceros. But remember Luceros is closed during the Mascleta s.\nDuring Hogueras, both TRAM trains and buses have special schedules.\nThe city hall runs a free service with stops near each of the Hoguear Especiales so it is easy to visit the most spectacular sculptures.\nTRAM Service in Hogueras\nThe TRAM train lines in Alicante have a special night schedule during Hogueras and the night fireworks week.\nCheck all the information about the tram special timetable for Hogueras in this link.\nRemember that Luceros station is closed during the Mascletas (from 13:30 to 14:20 19-24 of June) and there are special services every night during Hogueras and fireworks weeks.\nBus Mia Special Service for Hogueras\nMost of the bus services get diverted by the traffic closures and the central bus stops are moved to open to traffic bits of the city, such as Oscar Espla and Puerta del Mar .\nThere is also a special circular -and free- service during Hogueras to visit all the monuments in the special category.\nCircular Bus Route for Hogueras Especiales\nCrackers as a Tradition during Hogueras\nChildren and teenagers at school finish the classes right before the hogueras begin on the night of the 19th of June.\nThe festivity is shared by children with their parents and grandparents, teenagers, adult groups and, essentially, anyone in any age range and vital circumstance. This way to celebrate festivals is common in Spain.\nSomething that might be shocking to see is the crackers tradition. Children, literally, play with small crackers that they make explode using lighters or wicks.\nCrakers shop stand during Hogueras in Alicante. Nearby Alicante’s Train Station\nUsually, they are supervised by parents but not always. Be aware of this. Most of the crackers are small and can’t do much pain if exploding close to the body but still are noisy and can be frightening. Children might explode the crackers in the middle of the roads at times.\nThe Week of Midnight Fireworks: After the Crema\nFrom the 25th to the 29th, at midnight, there is a session of fireworks of around 15 minutes every night at 12.\nIn contrast with the mascletas , the fireworks are focused on colours and beautiful shapes as seen in many countries and films.\nFireworks at Alicante’s Postiguet Beach after Crema night\nThe best places to watch the fireworks are El Postiguet Beach and some spots in Serra Grossa and Avenida de Villajoyosa Road .\nThe fireworks are fired from El Coco , at the end of Postiguet Beach .\nDiving Deep into Hogueras : What Else Happens in The Bonfires Festival\nHoguras de San Juan in Alicante is a major event in the city. The events around it happen all year round, but there is even more during the 5 days of celebration. For example:\nbelleas elections\npregon\nparades and processions\nCabalgata del Ninot Or Ninot Parade\nLa Cablagata del Ninot – Ninot Parade- happens on the 10th of June every year. A multicoloured procession where each Hogueras commission parades disguised in relation to a topic they choose.\nNinot Parade in Alicante\nEach Hoguera competes with each other for a prize. The participants are people in the Hogueras commission and it is a family event where a lot of children, parents and older generations take part.\nChildren participating in El Ninot Parade in Alicante\nThe parade usually goes from Lucros Square to Alicante ‘s city hall .\nLa Planta\nLa Planta is a day set in the calendar when all Hogueras monuments have to be finished mounting: the 19th of June at 00:01 , in other words, the night from the 18th to the 19th of June.\nFirst Pieces of Hoguera Oficial\nHogueras are complicated structures and are always made of different pieces that need to be put together. There is also so much more apart from the main structure parts such as ninots , decorations, lighting, and weights to keep everything up… A planta of the biggest hogueras takes several days.\nEntrada de Bandas or Bands Parade\nOn the 17th of June , Entrada de Bandas Parade showcases all the hogueras committees or associations dressing in traditional Alicantininan suits and dresses. There are also them brass band with each committee.\nEntrada de Bandas Parade in Alicante\nThis parade is good to see traditional dresses in the region.\nOfrenda de Flores – Flower Offering\nLa Ofrenda de Flores or Flower Offering happens on two different days: the 21st and the 22nd.\nThis is a long-lived tradition in Hogueras -with a religious background- where each hoguera committee brings flowers to the Virgin of the Remedies. This Virgin is the patron saint of Alicante city and the flowers are offered to her as a symbol of gratitude.\nFlowers at San Nicolas co-cathedral for Virgin of the Remedies, patron saint of Alicante city\nThe parade ends in Alicante’s co-cathedral San Nicolas and can visit the flowers for the rest of the Hogueras festivity.\nDesfile Folclórico Internacional – International Folk Parade\nOn the 23rd of June is the International Folk Parade; a showcase of traditional folk clothing, dances and music coming from different parts of Alicante Province and region, the rest of Spain and guest countries.\nFor example, in Alicante’s province is common to celebrate the Moors and the Christians festivals:\nThe Moors and the Christians at Folk Parade in Alicante\nIn the region, it is also common to find los cabezudos or “the big-headed” during different celebrations:\nCabezudos at the Folk Parade in Alicante\nIn the Spanish region of Andalucia there is a big tradition of “Sevillanas” that are represented in this parade too:\nSevillanas at the Folk Parade in Alicante\nAnd lastly, as an example of one international guest, Ukraine has been part of the folk festival for a few years:\nUkraine as an international guest at Alicante’s folk parade\nEl Ninot Indultado\nA Ninot is a standalone Hogueras figure usually with a human resemblance.\nExample of a Ninot in Alicante\nEvery year, a ninot gets Indultado -or pardoned-. It is an important honour for the Hogura Commission as it is part of the prizes the Hogueras Federation gives.\nIf you want to see other’s years’ ninots you can visit the Hogueras Museum in Alicante.\nStreet Lights\nSimilar to what happens in most European cities at Christmas, Alicante’s streets get festive lighting for hogueras .\nDecoration lights during Hogueras\nUsually, the lighting is turned on a week -or more- before the planta (mounting) of hogueras .\nMost of the lights are in Alicante city centre.\nHogueras 2024 Schedule\nJune 1: Tribute to deceased Foguerers and Barraquers and Proclamation.\nJune 8: Entry of Bands and Commissions, from 6:00 p.m. to 11:59 p.m.\nJune 15: Ninot Parade, from 6:00 p.m. to 10:59 p.m.\nJune 16: Closing of the Ninot Exhibition, from 5:00 p.m. to 10:59 p.m.\nJune 17: Arribada del Foc, from 8:00 p.m.\nFrom June 18 to 24: Mascletaes, at 2:00 p.m.\nJune 21 and 22: Offering of Flowers, from 6:00 p.m.\nJune 22: Fogueres and Barraques awards parade, starting at 9:00 a.m.\nJune 23: International Folk Parade, from 7:30 p.m.\nJune 24: Monumental Palmera and Cremà de Fogueres.\nFrom June 25 to 29: Fireworks Contest.\nFrom 00:00 hours.\nJune 29: Multicolor Coso, from 6:00 p.m.\n( source in Spanish )\nHogueras de San Juan in Alicante VS the Rest of Spain\nAt this point, it is easy to understand Alicante’s views of the Midsummer Bonfires Festival are quite different from the rest of Spain.\nWhile most of Spain (in Spanish) celebrates the birth of John the Baptist on the night of the 23rd of June Alicante’s aligns with the pre-Christian Midsummer tradition celebrating the big bonfires burning on the night of the 24th.\nNevertheless, some people in Alicante still follow the Spanish tradition of joining groups of friends on the beach to prepare small bonfires with wood and paper to celebrate San John’s birth on the 23rd of June.\nHogueras de San Juan Night at El Postiguet Beach Alicante\nEl Postiguet Beach in Alicante gets usually extremely busy that night with people preparing bonfires or just having some food and drinks with friends. The bravest stay until the morning to see the beautiful sunrise.\nHistory of Hogueras de San Juan Festival In Alicante\nHogueras started in 1928. The idea spark initiated by José María Py (in Spanish) , an artist from Cadiz who lived in Valencia for 25 years.\nJosé got inspiration from the Fallas festivity and proposed to organise a festival in Alicante following the Saint John bonfire tradition. The mix of both resulted in Hogueras de San Juan Aliante ."

    "content_text": "Easter is a celebration of religious heritage celebrated in most of the traditionally Christian countries. Alicante ‘s traditions of Semana Santa have been deeply rooted in the population for centuries.\nEaster Float In Alicante\nAlicante’s Easter week sees processions with people dressed in religious attire, carrying Easter floats and brass bands playing traditional religious music. Unlike other places, Easter in Spain focuses on The Passion of Christ rather than the Resurrection.\nThe Holly Week in Alicante can be intense and alien at the same time. Nowadays Spanish society is not especially religious but some of the traditions during Easter are widely celebrated.\nContents\nToggle\nIs it Worth Visiting Alicante in Easter?\nAlicante is worth visiting during Easter. March and April are already warm months in Alicante so it is a perfect city break to enjoy the beaches (with lifeguard services active), the sun, the food and Easter traditions in Alicante, such as the Easter parades.\nEl Postiguet Beach Alicante in Easter\nEaster is a good time to visit Alicante as it doesn’t get as busy as in summer but the vibe is already summery.\nWhen is Easter in Spain and Alicante?\nIn 2024, Easter is from the 22nd of March to the 1st of April .\nEaster dates change every year and it is based on astronomy. Easter Sunday is the first Sunday right after the first astronomic full moon on the March equinox (when days start to be longer in the northern hemisphere than in the south). Exactly 40 days after Carnival ends and marks the beginning of Lent .\nBank and School Holidays in Alicante during the 2024 Easter\nAt schools , the 2024 Easter holidays in Alicante are from the 28th of March to the 8th of April . The 11th of April is also a school holiday as it is the Santa Faz peregrinate .\nAdult ‘s bank holidays in 2024 Easter are the 29th of March (Holy Friday), the 1st of April and the 11th of April as it is the Santa Faz peregrinate .\nAt the bottom of this article, there is the full timetable for the 2024 Easter parades and events in Alicante.\nThe Spanish commemorate the Passion of Jesus Christ -the period and events that happened before Jesus’ death- so the important dates to annotate are from Palm Sunday to Resurrection Sunday -the time when most of the events in Alicante will happen-.\nIn Spain, the only national bank holiday during Easter is Good Friday, but many regions add extra holidays. In Alicante , Easter Monday is a regional bank holiday too. Schools have a few more days of holidays around Easter.\nHere are the Holly Week dates for the next few years:\nYear Palm Sunday Good Friday Resurrection Sunday Easter Monday 2024 24th March 30th March 31st March 1st April 2025 13th April 19th April 20th April 21 April 2026 29th March 4th April 5th April 6th April 2027 21st March 27th March 28th March 29th March 2028 9th April 15th April 16th April 17th April 2029 25th March 31st March 1st April 2nd April 2030 14th April 20th April 21st April 22nd April Easter and Holly Week Calendar 2024-2030\nBest Easter Parades to Watch in Alicante\nThe best Easter Parades to watch in Alicante are:\nPalm Sunday – Processions and people celebrating with white palm tree leaves\nWednesday – Santa Cruz Brotherhood: In Santa Cruz Neighbourhood they parade the floats in between narrow and hilly streets\nSanta Cruz Float going up to the hermitage\nThursday – Santa Cena Brotherhood: They parade the biggest easter float in Spain (in Spanish)\nDomingo de Resurreción – Float dances in front of the City Hall and aleluyas release from the balcony\nMore information about all of this is below.\nWhat Happens in Alicante During Easter?\nThe Spanish tradition at Easter is to commemorate the Passion of Jesus Christ , the period and events that happened before Jesu’s death. As you know, Easter traditions in other countries are around the resurrection -and not the death- of Jesus Christ.\nThe events taking place during Holly Week are mainly parades with icons, dresses and music commemorating the events before the death and the resurrection. The vibe is somehow solemn.\nCounterintuitively, many people seeing the processions or even participating in the parades are not especially religious and maybe they have not even been in church in years. It is arguably safe to say that Easter in Spain is not about religion as much as it is about following traditions.\nThe Processions and Parades\nThe main events happening during the Holly Week are the parades .\nThere are many parades organised by cofradías or hermandades which we can translate as church brotherhoods .\nEach church brotherhoods organise a procession on a different day during the Holly Week and each day can have more than one procession happening.\nThe procession usually starts from a church and all of them must parade from their church to some of the streets in the city centre as per City’s Hall mandate. The tour all brotherhoods must parade is called carrera oficial which we can translate to the official route .\nUsually, Alicante’s carrera official is La Rambla Street so it is the place to see absolutely all the parades if that’s your intention.\nThe Easter processions are formed of 4 main elements:\nFloats usually carried on shoulders by costaleros\nVirgin Mary Float being Carried by Only Women\nMost of the time, each brotherhood has two floats, one featuring an image of Christ -normally at the crucifixion- and another with the image of the Virgin Mary but some of the parades may have different or more floats.\nThe people carrying the floats are called costaleros. Sometimes -and depending on the brotherhood-, the Virgin Mary float is carried by only women crew and the Christ by only men. This is true only sometimes as most of the time the costaleros are women or men indistinctively. There are also lighter floats for children and teenagers.\nBrass Bands , usually right after each of the Floats\nA Brass Bands Following a Float in Alicante\nThe Brass Bands usually play religious music. They are professional musicians making money per parade. Usually, the musicians are somehow stable in one Brass Band and they sometimes travel around different cities to fill up the demand for bands during easter.\nNazareno s -the people parading with religious attires and usually carrying small religious icons-\nNazarenos Waiting With Crosses At the Curch’s Entrance\nBetween floats, the nazarenos parade in different formations. They usually carry different stuff. Sometimes it is sweets for the children but other times they carry candles, wooden crosses or religious standards.\nManolas -women dressing in black-\nManolas In Alicante\nThe manolas have their origin in dictatorial Spain. Women had banned being nazareno s in the parades but still had an essential role in preparing the clothing and decoration of the floats.\nAround the XIX century, some of these women were allowed to parade in the processions using traditional clothing used on Sundays to go to church: a black dress, peineta and mantilla . Since then to our days this tradition has been kept despite the fact gender is not used to ban people anymore.\nChurch brotherhoods representatives or authorities\nParade Representatives in an Easter Procession in Alicante\nIn different places of the processions, there are different representatives. Sometimes they invite “honorific” people such as politicians -like in the photo above where Alicante’s city mayor in 2023, Luis Barcala, is parading too-. Other times they are church representatives or brotherhood directives.\nOther Events During Easter\nThere is much more happening during easter in Alicante.\nPalm Sunday\nParades with huge palm tree leaves were prepared for the occasion.\nSaetas\nAnother interesting tradition is the saetas -a religious song-, more common in Andalucia but a tradition also of some of the parades in Alicante.\nMasses\nMasses are common during easter but they are more popular among the people following the festivity as a Christian tradition rather than a popular celebration.\nStations of the Cross\nCalled Via Crucis in Spanish, is a commemoration of events that happened on the day of Jesus Christ’s crucifixion. This is also mainly followed among people celebrating the religious Semana Santa rather than the general public.\nEaster Day or Easter Sunday\nDuring Easter Day – Domingo de Resurreción in Spanish- some processions happen during the morning and they parade to Alicante’s city hall.\nIn Alicante, there is a singular event happening during this parade at the city hall. Thousands of little papers with religious images -called aleluyas – are dropped from the city’s hall balconies to the floats and the public:\nAleluyas being dropped to the floats and the public from Alicante’s city hall\nEaster Monday\nCalled Lunes de Pascua in Spanish it is an important day where monas are eaten. In Alicante, they are traditional pastry bread with a boiled egg on it. In other Spanish regions, monas are different.\nA common Alicantinian tradition during Easter Monday is to meet your friends and family for a short trip near the sea or in the mountains where to have lunch together in nature.\nFor many families, the tradition mandates squashing the boiled egg in someone else’s head in order to break the eggshell and to be able to peel it. Funny fights happen this day in all families.\nSemana Santa Dressing\nSomething to note is that many cofradias ‘ attires include a capirote -a hood with a conic shape and holes in the eyes-. It can remind certain sects in other countries. The Easter traditions in Spain are way older than these sects. Semana Santa traditions, including the dressing, originated in the XV century.\nNazarenos With Capirote in Alicante\nAll brotherhoods share the same style of attire: hoods, tunics, capirotes , the Manolas dresses, and iconography… But each congregation has different styles and colours, sometimes darker, other times colourful. It is up to each brotherhood tradition how they dress.\nTraditional Easter Food in Alicante\ntorrijas\nmona de pascua\ntoñas\nHistory of easter in Alicante\nAlicante’s Semana Santa starts around the year 1600. The origin took place in a little hermitage in the current Alicante city centre . In this little church, resided Virgen de la Soledad or Virgin of Solitude.\nAlicantinians founded in the hermitage a brotherhood called Purísima Sangre de Cristo or Pure Blood of Christ that would parade every Easter Friday in a procession conveniently called Entierro de Cristo or Burial of Christ. There is more about the history of Semana Santa in Alicante on this page (in Spanish) .\nAlicante Easter Transport\nAlicante’s Tram trains have night extra services running during the 27th, 28th and 29th of March in 2024.\nHere are the special TRAM Easter Transport times for 2024 easter.\n2024 Alicante’s Easter Timetable\n22nd of March to the 1st of April.

    "content_text": "All banks around Europe and the western world are very similar but it is a sector where different countries have different brands and each city has a different amount of branches for each bank. In addition, each bank has a different personality. If you are about to move it is good for you that you know the characteristics of banks in Alicante, Spain.\nA list of a few of the banks in Spain\nOne of the first things to point out is that some banks will ask you to have an NIE , Número de Identificación de Extranjero , which translates to Foreneer Identification Number. This number is a tax number that you will need if you want to work in the country and open an account in some banks. The Spanish have a number that accomplishes the same purpose called NIF.\nContents\nToggle\nPopular Banks In Alicante\nIn Alicante , there is a total of 171 traditional bank branches across the city. All big banks try to have, at least, a branch in each important city so it might be useful to open an account in one of the most popular entities.\nBank Name Branches Banco Sabadell 32 CaixaBank 44 Banco Santander 14 Bankia 14 BBVA 24 ING 1 Deutsche Bank 1 EVO 1 Bank branches in Alicante\nIt is important to mention that many banks in Spain usually charge a fee for taking out money from the cash machine from different banks’ ATMs. If getting cash out is essential to you you might double-check that before opening a bank account in traditional entities. Probably ING is the one on the list with the most flexible conditions to access cash for free. This is a typical characteristic of Banks in Alicante, Spain\nWhy you would need a traditional bank in Spain\nTraditional banks in Spain have most of the market. The Spanish tend to be more conservative than other nationalities when we speak about financial products and banks. That means that everybody will recommend you and propose to you to open an account in one of the most traditional banks as this is what they use and know. That will give you some advantages:\nAccess the Exclusive Services Bizzum\nThe biggest Spanish banks have teamed up to offer a service called Bizzum . This allows you to transfer the money instantaneously to your friends using the phone number. Both people need to be using Bizzum so they need a bank that supports the service. They have deliberately excluded some small and foreign banks to have a competitive advantage against them. Many young people use the service.\nAccess to Instant Money Transfers\nIncredibly, the transactions in Spain between different entities can take up to 3 days to complete. This situation has been changing in the last few years thanks to the introduction of a new transfer banking system called TIPS . This has been speeding up the transfers for the entities that have adopted the program. Traditional banks are more prepared and many times the money will arrive at the other account instantly… if both banks support the system. Small banks or neo banks might not have this system available .\nWhy you do not need a traditional bank in Alicante\nTraditional banks in Spain tend to be clunky. They all have an app for Android and iPhone but many times you still need to visit branches to open an account or get a new card. They are as well expensive.\nCommissions in Spanish Banks\nThe Spanish banks are very well known for having high commissions. It is very important that you triple-check the conditions and know if they will charge you money for having the account open, having a debit card or any other rule they might come with.\nAs well, it is very important that you understand where and where not you can take out money for free. They love competing between them by not allowing customers from other entities to take money out for free… and it can change overnight.\nRentability in Spanish Banks\nThe other side of the coin is profitability. No bank in the world will do a good job out of your many in commissions but the Spanish are below average on it. The way they usually offer the better commissions is when buying a financial product, that might be risky or not, and you compromise your money for the fixed term… and they will try to sell you the financial products using the branches employees or their apps. Always double-check before buying any of this.\nSearch for a Bank With Spanish IBAN\nIf you are from Europe you might know that transfers between the Eurozone are free of charge. Theoretically, the law is set to allow you to, for example, receive a salary in any euro bank even if it is not Spanish. The reality in Spain is that many systems are not adapted to this regulation and chances are that you might find issues using a bank with a foreign IBAN . Be sure that your bank (no issues if it is a traditional one) offers a Spanish IBAN starting with the international code “ES”.\nIf you Need a Bank Account in Spain Use a Neobank\nNeobanks are small to mid-size companies that are irrupting into the financial sector all around Europe. They usually offer way better conditions than big banks. For example, in order to attract clients, they might waive for you the commission big banks take for taking your money out at the cash machine. Or you will be able to pay in a different currency for free. They are secure because all financial institutions must follow the rules for bank deposit guarantees that might apply in their countries of origin. That’s the quickest way to get yourself sorted almost hassle-free.\nN26\nThis is probably your best option. N26 is a bank and they offer Spanish IBAN. It is free to use. If you leave Spain after some time you can keep your account open as no fees are charged. In addition, the card is free to get, to use, and you can pay in different currencies for free as well. It is mailed to your post.\nAny fee they might charge is communicated openly and transparently to you. They have an app and a website for accessing the online banking platform. Your money is guaranteed by the Compensation Scheme of German Banks. Up to €100.000. You can click here to open an account. Just so you know, I might do a bit of money if you use that link.\nOther Options That are Not as Good as They Seem\nThere are a few more digital banks that might look appealing. Revolut operates in Spain also. There are other Spanish start-ups such as Bnext.\nBe aware of the differences these new banks have with traditional financial institutions such as Sabadell or Santander. They have IBAN numbers for their customers but Revolut and Bnext are not banks but electronic money services.\nThe settle difference means that they can not offer credits, loans or mortgages and the founds guarantees are slightly different. Your money is safe but they are not compatible with all payees, such as with government-transferred funds.\nYou are better set with a full bank such as N26, Openbank (Santander’s fully online brand) or ING as your main bank and then use the electronic money new banks as your secondary bank account.\nAlso, in Spain is very popular the usage of Bizzum . So when integrating with locals it is easier to have one account in one traditional bank to get access to the service.\nI hope you have now a better idea of what are the characteristics of banks in Alicante, Spain. If you have any experience in banking in the country or you still have any doubt, please, feel free to leave a comment below!"

The virtual operators usually specialise in different clients’ needs such as low cost, topnotch customer service or English-speaking customers.\nSome OMVs in Spain are:\nLobster.es (5€ discount) for English-Speaking Customers\nPepephone.com for topnotch customer service plus electricity and fibre optic bills\no2online.es is the second Movistar brand for mobile and fibre services that\nSymio is Orange’s low-cost brand\nLebara is the second brand in Masmovil (previously Vodafone) for international customers with links to other countries\netc…\nAs in many other countries, there is not a big difference in prices and coverage between networks. Any network will provide 4G+ or 5G technology in any major city, like Alicante . But not all OMVs have 5G yet (but just 4G+).\nIf your stay in Spain is short and you have a European SIM card you can use your phone as if you were in your home country thanks to the European free-roaming. But if your stay is longer or needs a lot of data you should probably get a Spanish SIM card.\nBe sure you check with your network operator if travelling from the UK. Many big brands have removed the free-roaming to European countries! So your Instagram scrolling on one of Alicante’s beaches might end up being expensive if you don’t check.\nHow to Buy a SIM Card in Alicante and Spain\nIn Spain, when buying either a prepaid or contract SIM card you must show a type of photo ID that will be registered.\nValid proofs of identity are:\nyour passport,\nthe driving license,\na national ID,\nthe Spanish NIE if you are a resident.\nEven if you get the local Spanish SIM card delivered the postperson will require you to show your ID proof.\nGenerally, the best (cheaper) deals are on the small OMV but most don’t have fiscal stores where to buy the SIM card and everything is ordered and done online.\nFor example, you can have a Lobster SIM card for 12€ that gives you 20GB of data and free-roaming to the EU and the UK at the time of updating this article. If online is an issue, buying a SIM card in any physical store of the major brands should do the trick. Some network stores will have available their second brands SIM cards to purchase.\nHow many mobile operators are there in Spain?\nThere are 4 mobile network operators with a radio spectrum: Vodafone, Movistar, Masmovil/Yoigo and Orange. There are many MVNOs ( OMV in Spanish) such as PepePhone, Lebara, Lobster, Symio, O2 and many others.\nAfter all this information if you might still have a question. Or maybe you have some experience with network operators in Spain. If so, please, leave a comment!"

    "content_text": "When staying in Spain for longer periods of time the local language starts being more and more necessary. If you still want to keep the need for Spanish to a minimum there are a few tricks to be less dependent on your language knowledge. Good news: in Span, there are mobile operators for Spanish SIM cards that speak English.\nSIM Cards\nIn Spain, there are a number of mobile operators providing local Spanish SIM cards for English Speakers, such as lobster.es or hitsmobile.es . Their app, website, and customer support are in English . All these MVNOs use the radio spectrum and antennas of the main companies so the best service is guaranteed.\nBut what is the best English-speaking network for a SIM card in Spain? how do I get the SIM card? does it work on my phone? Let’s going to answer all these questions and more. Content:\nEnglish Speaking SIM Card Providers\nMobile Networks in Spain\nHow to Get a Spanish SIM Card?\nOther SIM Mobile Operators (That Only Speak Spanish)\nCan You Put a Spanish SIM Card in an English Phone?\nPrepaid SIM Card\nPhone Numbers Anatomy in Spain\nContents\nToggle\nEnglish Speaking SIM Cards Providers\nAn NVNO is a SIM card operator that resells the service of a bigger brand that owns the infrastructure. In Spain, they are called OMVs (Operador Movil Virtual or Virtual Mobile Operator).\nMVNOs have the freedom to tailor their customer support and features such as roaming or call minutes to certain countries as per their niche needs.\nThis is why we can find the perfect Spanish local phone SIMs providers for English speakers: some networks offer the website, customer support and apps in English.\nSo if you are from an English-speaking country, an international student, your English is better than your Spanish, a digital nomad, an ex-pat… don’t fall on the big 4 networks as there might be a better company for you.\nPrices are usually similar between networks as the competition is high in Spain. If there are any differences they will be of very few euros per month. The differences are high only on services such as roaming or international call minutes.\nList of English-Speaking SIM Operators:\nNetwork Name New Customer Discount In English? Parent Network Speed International Calls Payment Shops eSIM lobster.es Yes, 5€ using ref link Yes. Website, App and Customer Support Movistar 4G+ (up to 300Mbps) Yes, to the UK and other EU countries. Pay As You Go/Prepaid Yes No hitsmobile.es No Yes. Website, App and Customer Support (also in German) Vodafone 4G (up to 150Mbps) Yes, to the UK and other EU and international countries (but contract only). Pay As You Go/Prepaid and Contract Yes No digimobil.es No Only some bits of the website. They can attend in English by email, on Facebook or on Instagram Movistar 4G+ (up to 300Mbps) In some of their tariffs Pay As You Go/Prepaid and contract Yes No avatel.es/en No Movistar 4G (up to 150Mbps) No Pay As You Go No No jetnet.es/en No Some bits of the website. Orange 4G (up to 150Mbps) No Pay As You Go No No English Speaking Mobile Operators’\nThe speeds offered by each network are based on this article from AdslZone (in Spanish).\nSome of these operators are offering combos for landline phones and/or fibre optics (or internet through other techs) to your home. Some of them offer landline internet on Costa Blanca/ Alicante or Costa del Sol/Malaga and other places where English is spoken by a big chunk of the population.\nMany of these networks also have agreements with physical stores where to go and buy the SIM. This option might be more convenient if you don’t want to wait for the delivery to come to your place.\nThere are other MVNOs that have free calls to Europe in their tariffs, such as Lebara or Lycamobile but no English Customer service, website or apps.\nWhat is Important to Look at When You are Choosing Your English Speaking Network in Spain?\nThere are some factors that are more important than others when choosing a network. Here is a list of what I consider more important:\nNetwork coverage is only important if you live or move around often in a bad coverage area. If not, it is safe to ignore this factor.\nCustomer service might be necessary at times so better to choose networks with good customer service\nPrices should be fair but they are usually very similar on data and call minutes\nSIM delivery times/store support\nMinutes to call other countries and free-roaming when travelling\nPay As You Go/Prepaid vs Contract\nLength of your stay in Spain. A contract is fine if you live in the country, Pay As You Go/Prepaid is good either if your stay is shorter or live in Spain\nAnd here is what is not important:\nNetwork coverage if you live in an area, such as a city, with good coverage\nMax theoretical network speed if you don’t tether from your phone very often\nAs long as the prices are fair, it might not be necessary to look for the cheapest deal if other compromises need to be taken\nMobile Networks in Spain\nSpanish SIM card market is very similar to any other European country. There are 4 networks with fiscal infrastructure such as antennas and frequencies. In Spain they are:\nMovistar\nVodafone\nOrange\nYoigo/Masmovil (it shares antennas with Movistar and Orange in the places where it doesn’t have its owns)\nThese 4 networks have their own main and niche brands but they are obligated to rent their networks to other MVNOs. They are called Operadores Moviles Virtuales (OMVs) in Spanish which translates to Virtual Mobile Operators.\nMobile Coverage in Spain\nThe good news is that the coverage in Spain is very high on any of the 4 networks but there are small differences. In this image from OpenSignal , you can see the nuances of each network. Usually, Movistar overperformances most of the metrics but the differences are small.\nFrom: © Opensignal Limited\nThe coverage is the location where the phone signal is available. It is in the last row in the table and it is very similar on both networks Movistar and Orange.\nBut how can you check you have coverage in the place where you are going to use your phone the most?\nWell, if you are in a big city, such as Alicante or Malaga , then the difference in coverage is going to be a minimum. But if you live in a little town the differences can increase.\nNote that the English mobile network you choose will use one of these parents’ mobile networks.\nMovistar Mobile Coverage\nMovistar has the coverage maps in this link (in Spanish).\nMovistar coverage per technology on April 2022\nNote that they don’t offer yet a 5G coverage map on their website but it is likely your phone will connect to 5G in most of the bigger cities.\nVodafone Mobile Coverage\nVodafone has its coverage map on this link (in Spanish).\nVodafone coverage per technology on April 2022\nThey don’t have a 2G map, but nowadays this service is only a low-quality voice service and is considered a legacy by most networks.\nOrange Network Coverage\nOrange’s coverage map is in this link (in Spanish).\nOrange coverage per technology on April 2022\nThey mix all the techs on one map.\nYoigo Network Coverage\nYoigo’s coverage map is in this link (in Spanish).\nOrange coverage per technology on April 2022\nYoigo/and Masmovil are in the same corporate group now. Their antennas are not as extended as other networks so Movistar and Orange share their infrastructure with Yoigo/Masmovil where they don’t reach.\nDifferences Between the big 4 and the MVNOs\nThe 4 companies with frequencies (Yoigo/Masmovil, Movistar, Orange and Vodafone) have to provide access to their networks to the NVNOs over a private agreement or a regulated price.\nThis legislation allows the consumer to choose SIMs providers in between a heterogeneous range of options. Some MVNOs are not different companies per se but different brands of one of the big 4 networks. They sometimes use different brand names for different niches that their main brand can’t fulfil.\nBut other MVNOs are totally separate companies that just rent most of the infrastructure but still have their own systems for billing or other technicalities (MSC, HLR…)\nUsually, customers on MVNOs will not get access to all the features the main brand can offer. For example, 4G and 5G technologies arrive in MVNOs’ customers a few months or years after the main brands’ customers get them.\nAlso, some other technologies such as VoiceHD or 4G+ (that offers 300Mbps vs 150Mbps on 4G) might not be available on MVNOs.\nBut the main features such as traditional calling or acceptable internet speed are maintained. Also, the network coverage is the same.\nHow to Get a Spanish SIM Card?\nThe process is pretty simple and similar in all the networks:\nTime needed: 3 days\nSteeps for getting a Spanish SIM Card\nChoose your network\nSIM card companies such as Lobster (5€ discount ref link) or Digimobile have full support in English.\nBuy the SIM online or head to one of the shops\nSIM cards are available from two main places:\n– online at the network’s website to get it delivered by mail\n– shops where the SIM is sold\nIdentify yourself\nIn Spain, you must identify yourself using a photo ID card or passport in order to be handled the SIM card.\nIn online deliveries, the mail carrier will do this task. In the shops, the staff will identify you.\nActivate the SIM\nThe last step is to activate the SIM on the network’s website after you have received it and start using it on your phone.\nOther SIM Mobile Operators (That Only Speak Spanish)\nIn Spain, there are many SIM card providers but they offer their services only in Spanish. On this page, there is more information about other mobile operators in Spain that don’t speak English .\nCan You Put a Spanish SIM Card in an English Phone?\nYes. All the phones sold to work in Europe are compatible around all the European continent but you need to be sure the phone is network unlocked . This is because Europe uses the standard cell technology called GSM. So it doesn’t matter if your phone is British, Norwegian or from anywhere else. It will work if unlocked.\nFor phones from other continents can be a bit more tricky, you need to check first your phone is compatible with GSM, in countries such as the United States the cell tech some operators use is called CDMA. Many phones can connect to both networks even though they might be best optimised for one of them. Check the specification of your phone on this topic.\nChecking if Your Phone is Network Locked\nIf you bought your phone through a carrier under a fix term contract chances are your phone is network locked and you won’t be able to use it in Spain.\nAn easy trick to check if your phone is unlocked is borrowing a SIM card from someone you know is on a different network. If your phone is able to connect then it is unlocked.\nGetting your phone unlocked is totally legal and your provider has to facilitate the unlock code when your contract ends if you ask for it. This is true for the EU and the UK.\nOnce your phone is unlocked then it will work on any carrier in Spain.\nPrepaid SIM Card\nMost English Speaker mobile operators in Spain have contracts and Pay As You Go tariffs.\nPay As You Go is mostly the same as prepaid but you need a debit or credit card to pay the monthly fee for the service.\nIf you want a traditional prepaid SIM card you were no debit/credit card is necessary will need to give up the English-speaking networks and default to one of the bigger brands: Movistar, Orange, Vodafone or Yoigo/Masmovil. In this article, there is more about non-English speaker networks in Span.\nIf your stay in Spain is short you might want to get just a Pay As You Go SIM card. The best option is again one of these providers. They will have cheaper prices than traditional prepaid from big companies and you can cancel anytime.\nPhone Numbers Anatomy in Spain\nThe Spanish phone mobile phone numbers look like this:\n(+34) 6XX XX XX XX\nor\n(+34) 7XX XX XX XX\nBut numbers starting at 7 are less common and, indeed, many Spaniards don’t know mobile phone numbers can start at 7. These numbers have been around for a while now though and have no difference in pricing with the numbers starting on 6.\nThe Spanish landlines phone numbers look like this:\n(+34) 9XX XX XX XX\nEach region has unique 2 numbers following the 9. For example, numbers from Alicante are like:\n(+34) 965 XX XX XX\n(+34) 966 XX XX XX\nBut other regions have different numbers after the 9.\nCan I buy a Spanish SIM card in the UK?\nNo, Spanish law mandates identifying the customer buying the SIM card and can’t be done in different countries.\nCan I buy s Spanish SIM Card Online?\nSpanish SIM cards can be bought online or in-store. The owner of the new line has to identify himself using a valid photo ID such as a passport or national ID as per Spanish law."

Some beaches in Alicante are better suited for families, groups of friends, naturists or dog owners. Let’s going to dive into each of the best beaches in Alicante city.\nContents\nToggle\nBeaches In Alicante:\nAlicante city has more than +10 beaches but allows me to give you my recommendation.\nIf you are going to be a day or two in Alicante go to El Postiguet . It is in the centre of Alicante . If you stay central then you can just walk. If you are further away it is super well connected by public transport.\nIf you have time and want to go to a bigger and also very beautiful beach San Juan Beach is a must. It is well connected by public transport and it is big and beautiful.\nIf you are staying longer then you can enjoy visiting the different beaches and coves around the city.\nIn case you want to go to the beach with your pet there is a dog beach in Alicante . Also, all the beaches are open for dogs in winter, from the 1st of November to the 1st of March.\nHere is the complete and ultimate list of beaches in Alicante:\nPlaya de El Postiguet (top beach)\nPlaya San Juan (top beach)\nPlaya de la Isla de Tabarca (top beach)\nPlaya de Urbanova (top beach)\nCalas de el Cabo de las Huertas (top coves)\nPlaya de la Albufereta (nice beach)\nPlaya de la Almadraba\nPlaya para perros de Agua Amarga (dog’s beach)\nPlaya de San Gabriel\nCalas de Serragrosa\nDuring summer, water temperatures can reach up to 26.3°C (79.34°F) on average in August (it is common to find the waters even hotter). And in winter, it goes down to 14.1°C (57.38°F) on average so the minimum temperature of the water can be lower. This data is from weather-atlas.com .\nIt is safe to say that the beaches can be enjoyed anytime from May (19.1°C or 66.38°F) to October (22.4°C or 72.32°F). As the winter in Alicante can cool down the sea temperature a bit more going for a swim from November to April is only for the bravest.\nDogs in Alicante Beaches\nDogs are allowed on the beach during the low season, from the 1st of November to the 1st of March. Outside that period dogs are allowed only on the dog beach Agua Amarga .\nHere are the rules to follow:\nPrevent the dogs from causing damage to plants or other wild animals\nPrevent the dog from disturbing other bathers and beach users\nThe droppings of the animals must be collected immediately and deposited in the bins\nLimit the number of dogs per adult to no more than two and one if the dog is classed as from a dangerous breed\nDogs must be controlled by the owners at all times; visible and under control voice\nDo not allow animals to dig\nDogs classified as potentially dangerous will be restrained and with a muzzle\nAggressive or non-socialized dogs have prohibited access\nMinors under 16 years of age do not have access to the beaches with animals if they are not supervised by an adult\nDogs in heat, sick animals or puppies under 4 months of age can not get into the beach\nAll animals must be censed and will carry a microchip and passport sanitary with updated obligatory prophylactic treatments\nThe owners must have the leash available, and the animals will have collars but spiked or choke collars are not allowed.

If you are staying near the city centre El Postiguet is just within a stone’s throw. It is a well-maintained beach protected on its sides by land so rough weather doesn’t affect this that much to this beach. It is 900m long so it is a medium-sized beach compared to other beaches in Alicante.\nEl Postiguet is one of the most crowded beaches in Alicante. All sorts of public find El Postiguet appealing as it is the most urban and central beach in Alicante. Usually, tourists and younger people tend to find a spot closer to the city centre and the Melia hotel. Older people and families tend to lie on the furthest half part of the beach. This is, of course, a very broad distinction.\nThe beach counts on Baywatch, first aid, local police, toilets, foot showers, volleyball net, chiringuito and other services… There is outdoor and indoor parking next to the beach that tends to get busy during peak season.\nThe views are quite picturesque. Playa de El Postiguet is one of the places where you can see The Moor Face on the Castillo de Santa Barbara hillside. The beach’s name comes from the language Valencian (a variant of Catalan) and means “little door”. The old walls protecting the city underneath the castle had an access door to the beach, hence the literal translation of Playa de El Postiguet would be The Beach of the Small Door .\nWhat services does El Postiguet Beach have?

San Juan Beach has all the services you might expect from a high-quality beach in Alicante. There is a lot of space to accommodate lots of people due to its size.\nThe only downside is its exposure to the open sea. San Juan beach can be affected by rough weather more than other beaches in Alicante. During the hottest months, some mild wind will be present every day during the sun’s peak hours of the day. This is called terminal wind and is due to the temperature difference between the water and the land. Colder water provokes colder air. Hot land generates hotter air. Therefore, the wind will blow from the sea direction to land as the hotter air goes up into the atmosphere to be replaced by the colder sea air.\nThermal wind is fantastic for sailing and water sports. It usually doesn’t get too intense so the breeze is welcome during the hot summer temperature. The wind might create a few small wawes though.

It is situated 22km from the centre of Alicante, counterintuitively, it is still part of the municipal term of Alicante city. The island of Tabarca is a magnificent place to visit. Ships have regular services to the islands from Santa Pola (shortest trip), Alicante and Benidorm (longest trip).\nThe island has one beach with all the services found on the rest of the city’s beaches: lifeguard, first aid foot showers, local police office… There are also several coves and places where you can go for a swim but are not being monitored by the lifeguards.\nThe island is small. Next to the beach at Isla de Tabarca , there are several places to have lunch or dinner. The traditional dish of Tabarca is Caldero . A fish-based dish. If you are looking for rice you can also ask in most of the restaurants. In Alicante, Paella is not a traditional rice dish and is only prepared for tourists. If you want to be sure of not falling into a tourist trap search for places announcing Arroz rather than Paella. It is a very similar dish made in the same pan but with a slightly different, and arguably better, style.\nTabarca’s beach has a heterogenic public that tends to be more adult and touristic. Many local people won’t get into the bout to Tabarca to go to the beach and, if they do, they might instead go to some of the beautiful coves rather than the beach itself. There are several clifts around the island that teenagers, (and no teenagers), use as trampolines to jump into the sea. Please, be aware this can be very dangerous and is not strange to read local news about someone getting seriously hurt by this practice every summer.\nTabarca is probably the best place on the Alicantinan coast to do snorkelling. Even better than Cabo de Las Huertas . Tabarca is a maritime reserve which means that fishing is forbidden and bouts have limited right to anchor depending on where Isla de Tabarca maritime reserve area they are situated. This measure allows flora such as Posidonia (Mediterranean endemic sea plant) and the different fish species to beautifully and picturesquely grow in the area.\nThe island has also public toilets next to the beach. In the same building complex, there is a museum that explains the centuries-long history of the island and the flora and fauna that can be found at Tabarca Island.\nThere are also some shops where to find typical beach products, such as icecreams, SPF cream and other beach items. Have in mind that the island can get ridiculously busy during peak season. It also can be extremely empty outside the tourist season. The same is happening with bouts anchoring around the beach.\nTakeaways\nWhat services does Tabarca Island Beach have? Full body showers, first aid and lifeguard, public toilets, sunbeds and umbrellas to rent, pedal boats… Note not all services will be always available.\nAre there public toilets at Tabarca Island Beach? Yes. There are public toilets available that open following a schedule.\nWho is Tabarca beach for? Adventurous people who want a boat trip to the island and enjoy island vibes.\nDoes el Tabarca Island Beach have Blue Flag? Yes\nTabarca Island Beach type: Semi-urban with golden sand\nCabo de Las Huertas Coves\nCabo de Las Huertas literal translation is Cape of the Orchards . Traditionally, the cape was used as land to grow food plants. Now, it is one of the most expensive and beautiful areas in the city of Alicante. El Cabo has a historic defence tower and a lighthouse for sailors in its inland area. The coast has several coves.\nCove at El Cabo de Las Huertas\nEl Cabo de las Hu ertas coves are probably the second-best place for snorkelling in the city of Alicante, after Tabarca island, so it might be the best place on Alicante’s mainland. There are several coves with different ease of access. For example, Cala de la Palmera , probably the most famous cove, has no regulated lifeguards and no tarmac parking space for cars to park. The access to the coves is rocky and hilly. Ironically, good hiking shoes are encouraged as you will need to pass through short but hiking-like paths.\nOnce you are at the cove, there are just a very few places with sand. It is recommended to also have aquatic shoes you can use for swimming as the accesses to the sea are sometimes through beaches or coves with rocks instead of sand.\nIt is a perfect place to explore different areas. If you head right while looking at the sea you will get closer to Alicante centre and the views of Santa Barbara Castle , El Postiguet beach and further places such as Tabarca Island or El Palmeral Park . The views are a sight for sore eyes. If you head left, you will get closer to San Juan beach but the cape shape doesn’t allow you to see San Juan beach until you are literally next to it.\nHere is the list of recognised coves at El Cabo . Click to find the location on Google Maps: Cala de la Palmera , La Calita , Cala Cantalar , Cala de los Judios . Rember that a common strategy is to park at Cala de la Palmera and walk from there to the different coves.\nCala de la Palmera has a parking lot with no tarmac. Other coves might have parking spaces available also. The closest tram line 4 stop might be Cabo Huertas and the closest bus stop Camino del Faro 17 on Alicante bus services line 22 .\nTakeaways\nWhat services does El Cabo de Las Huertas have? Only parking and bins in some areas are available.\nAre there public toilets at El Cabo de las Huertas? No, there are no public toilets available.\nWho is El Cabo de Las Huertas coves for?

It doesn’t have most of the services that other beaches have. For example, there is no lifeguard, first aid services or foot showers.\nSan Gabriel Beach\nThis beach in the San Gabriel neighbourhood serves people living locally that want to get a quick bath and not spend much time commuting. Is not in such a privileged area as other beaches and the views are not so impressive yet you can see boats and ships coming in and out from the harbour. It has beautiful views of Tabarca island , Urbanova beach and south of Alicante’s province up to Santa Pola cape.\nThe beach is officially recognised by the city hall so it has litter bins, and wood access gateways and it is cleaned and maintained but just not daily as most of the other beaches in Alicante city.\nAs it is well known to everyone, the rivers for inland cities and the sea for coastal cities are the way out for sewer waters after they are cleaned in the treatment plants. Between the San Gabriel beach and the port of Alicante entrance, there is one of the pipes releasing treated water into the sea. This pipe has previously released untreated water due to technical issues or extreme weather conditions at the treatment plant.\nAlicante’s city hall has recursively forbidden the bath in San Gabriel beach until neighbours would complain too much about the restriction to then allow the bath again and improve the cleaning services to forbid the bath once again . It is a polemic beach due to its closeness to the sewer pipe and how near is to the harbour. It has always been a fight between the neighbours who want to use it and the city hall that wants it completely unattended this beach.\nClick here to read the full article about San Gabriel Beach, with more photos and information.\nTakeaways\nWhat services does San Gabriel Beach have?

    "content_text": "El Cabo (or The Cape in English) de las Huertas is one of the most beautiful swimming areas in the city of Alicante\nCabo de San Juan or San Juan Cape is an area of Alicante city between La Almadraba Beach and San Juan Beach . It is known for its expensive houses and truly beautiful coves. As it is an extended rocky area, there are no lifeguard services and some people practice naturism outside the most famous coves.\nCoves At El Cabo de San Juan\nThere are some top coves with a parking lot where it is easy to expand the towel or even get a shadow from the high rocks. This is the most savage place to swim on all of Alicante’s beaches . Let’s going to take a look.\nContents\nToggle\nCoves at El Cabo de San Juan\nMost of El Cabo has little spots where you can go for a swim or lie on the towel to tan under the sun. But there are a few coves that have a parking lot nearby and are more known. There is also public transport you can use to get there.\nMap of Coves and trails at El Cabo de San Juan Alicante\nLet’s gonna explore the most famous coves.\nLa Palmera Cove\nOne of the most known coves at El Cabo is La Palmera (which translates to the Palm Tree). Ironically, the cove doesn’t have more palm trees, or trees in general, than other coves in El Cabo .\nLa Palmera Cove at El Cabo de San Juan\nThis cove has a small beach that makes your life easier to get into the water. I would still recommend wearing wet shoes to walk around. Also, the beach is small and can get a bit crowded so you might want to access through the other parts of the cove.\nThere are flat rocky areas that are under the water but just at the ankles high. Those rocks create a kind of natural trampoline when they just end like on an aquatic cliff. In there, you will need your aquatic shoes.\nCantalar Cove\nThis is the second most famous cove in El Cabo . The set-up is similar to La Palmera : a small beach with rocky areas around it.\nCantalar Cove in El Cabo de San Juan\nAgain, I would recommend the use of wet shoes.\nThe disadvantage of this cove versus La Palmera is the access. Wherever you park the car or you are left to the closest point to the cove there will be a 5 to 10 minutes walk.\nThe best places to park are…\nNaturist Zones\nEl Cabo has traditionally been a territory for naturist swimmers. During peak time in summer is not that common to find them on the main coves.\nNaturist Girl at El Cabo de San Juan in Alicante\nIf you want to get naked at El Cabo during summer you can just walk to the places next to the most crowded coves areas where other tanners will also lay with no fabrics on the rocks.\nServices at El Cabo de Las Huertas\nAs you can see, there are different coves and places to go for swimming. You can just go swimming anywhere in El Cabo de San Juan if you are good at easy rock climbing.\nThis freedom has a counterpart: there are no official services at Cabo de San Juan .\nNo lifeguards, no bins, no cleaning services, no toilets… nothing. Just you, the sea and the other swimmers and tanners.\nBut don’t get down by this lack of services, the area is beautiful and calmer than beaches such as El Postiguet . If you are living in Alicante or staying for a longer time, it is worth visiting this amazing part of the city.\nHow to Get to El Cabo?\nDifferent coves and areas might have better/different car parks bus and Tram stops.\nTo La Palmera Cove\nThis is probably the best-communicated cove at El Cabo .\nBy Tram train, the best stop is Cabo Huertas on lines 4 and 5 and it takes about 15-20 min to walk to the cove. By the way, all info about how to pay for the Tram, trains, fares, zones, etc in this article.\nBy bus , the best stop is Camino del Faro 17 , on lines 22 and 22N and, to the cove, it takes about 10 min.\nAlso, there are two parking lots in La Palmera next to each other. One has tarmac the other no. Both parking gives an okay car capacity to La Palmera . And I mean that don’t expect to find easy parking space on a Saturday morning in August but a Saturday morning in September should be okay.\nHere is the one with the tarmac:\nParking lot without tarmac at La Palmera Cove\nAnd here is the one that doesn’t have tarmac:\nTo El Cantalar Cove\nThe Cove El Cantalar have slightly more difficult access than La Palmera . The places where you can park the car or get off the bus are about 500m or 0.3 miles from the actual cove.\nThe path to get to the cove is a dirt track. It goes through a beautiful pine forest and the difficulty is very low.\nThe bus stop to get to the cove is Tridente – Costa Blanca on bus line 22 and bus night line 22N . It takes about 10 min to walk to the cove.\nBus Line 22 dropping off passengers at Tridente – Costa Blanca\nThe TRAM of Alicante stop is Tridente on lines 4 and 5. It will take you about 20 minutes to walk to the cove.\nIf you are coming by car or motorbike there are a couple of parking spaces for you to use:\nThis is the main parking lot for El Cantalar Cove. There are a few other streets around there where you can try your luck. As this parking is not serving only this cove will get full very fast, especially in peak months in summer.\nParking near by el Cantalar Cove\nTips \u0026 Recommendations\nThis area is not guarded by the live servers so it is crucial to extreme precautions when you go to the sea:\nFrom the coves, it should be easy to get in and out of the sea but there are many rocky areas that make things more difficult. Do not risk getting injured going swimming in a place with difficult access.\nIf the sea is rough, better to just get in/out on the cove’s beaches or not go for a swim at all.\nIt is easier to move around when inside the water with wet shoes. There might be rocks and sea plants even on the sandy coves.\nClean after yourself. Bins and cleaning services are not available.\nPlan the circumstance that you won’t find a toilet. There is shrubbery or the actual sea, just have all that in mind.\nUse solar protection and drink water. Always.\nAgain, do not take risks. Maybe other swimmers and tanners won’t be able to help you."

    "content_text": "Agua Amarga is a beautiful raw beach In Alicante. It is not the most meticulously maintained beach in the city but it is the dog’s beach par excellence in Alicante: pets can enter all year around.\nAgua Amarga Dog’s Beach Alicante\nAgua Amarga is the only beach in Alicante that allows pets all year round. It is accessible by car and bus but pets are not allowed on Alicante’s busses . It is a 250 meters long raw beach in between urban areas. The beach is sandy with some rocks. Pets need to be watched as the area is not fenced. The car park has space for many cars but it gets busy during peak season.\nIt is a beautiful raw doggy beach with some services such as lifeguards. It is also right next to Urbanova beach so the promenade and services such as public toilets are 10 min walk away.\nContents\nToggle\nBeach Description\nAgua Amarga is in between urbanized areas in Alicante city . That is a unique feature of Alicante’s city beaches as all the rest are situated in urbanized or semi-urbanised zones. Plus it allows pets to play on the sand and go for a swim all the year-round.\nIt is a 25 meters or 820 feet long beach with basic services such as a car park, bins, sand cleaning and lifeguards during peak season.\nA dog enjoying the dog’s beach in Alicante\nThe beach is unprotected inside the wider Alicante bay, facing east. So it will suffer from weather changes as much as its sister’s beach Urbanova . The water temperature in summer goes from 19ºC as a minimum in June to 27ºC max in August and September.\nThere is a fenced area for pets to use as a toilet but it is currently destroyed.\nThe Sand at the Dog’s Beach\nThe sand is slightly whiter than on other beaches. It is mixed with tiny bits of old shells and mixed with boulders rocks.\nThe sand grain is bigger than on other Alicante beaches but overall is good to be enjoyed and feels like a natural beach.\nDog’s Beach Rules\nThe doggy beach has some rules so dogs and owners can fully enjoy it.

There are only basic services:\nBasic cleaning service.\nBins\nLifeguards/first aid\nCar park with a lot of space (bussy on peak season)\ndogs park (currently broken)\nCurrently Broken Dog’s Park\nNote there are no foot showers at Agua Amarga Dogs Beach.\nHow to Get to the Dogs’ Beach in Alicante\nThere are two main ways to get to the beach: by foot or by car.\nWalking to the dogs’ beach is technically possible but it is far from the city centre. For example, the distance between El Postiguet Beach and Agua Amarga beach is 8km or 5mi (about 2h walk). Using the bike is not yet an easy alternative as the cycling line from the city centre to the beach is not finished yet.\nIn reality, the only way to get to the beach with your dog is by car as buses in Alicante don’t allow bigger pets like dogs .\nBus Service to Agua Amarga\nThe bus service going from Alicante to Agua Amarga dogs’ beach is line 27 (Urbanova) .\nBus Line 27 Return Trip\nThe first stop in Alicante is Óscar Esplá 23 .

The bus frequency is between 65 and 60 min.\nCar to Agua Amarga Dogs’ Beach\nThe car is probably the best option for you and your pets. Agua Amarga and Urbanova are the beaches with the most car park spaces. Also, they are the worst connected with public transport.\nCar Park at Agua Amarga dog’s beach on a no-peak day of the year\nThere is neither a safe way to walk nor a finished cycle line to those beaches. The car park is here:\nNote it is not a tarmacked car pack and it is compacted land instead. Also, note that there are plenty of parking spaces but it will get busy during peak season and peak time during the day.\nTips \u0026 Recomendations\nThe car park will get busy very fast. The sooner you go the most empty it will be.\nRemember the Spaniards go to have lunch about 1:30-3:00 pm so might be a bit less busy at that time. But It will be extremely hot.\nAlways use sun protection cream.\nAlways do what the lifeguards say to do.

There is not an easy connection to La Almadraba Beach for cyclists.\nThe roads don’t have cycling lines and there are sections where cars go kind of fast. Cycling on the round is permitted if you are brave enough.\nCar to La Almadraba\nThe beach La Almadraba has a car park with more spaces than other beaches. At the same time is one of the beaches worst connected by public transport, probably as bad as the beach in Urbanova .\nThe difference is that La Almadraba has little car parking compared to Urbanova but La Almadraba is less popular.\nThe final result is that there will be queues for parking if you go to the beach during summer and peak hours but there are more chances to park next to the beach than in El Postiguet or in San Juan but it will take more time than in Urbanova (click on the beaches names if you want to know more about them).\nWho is La Almadraba for?\nThe beach is for people who value more cosiness and calm water rather than sand quality.

Sometimes you can find them having food or drinks together when is not peak season.\nNevertheless, is a good beach to try if you are staying in Alicante for longer periods but not if you are a few days tourist as there are other better beaches to visit in Alicante.

    "content_text": "The beach San Gabriel in Alicante is one of the +10 beaches in the city ( click to see the list of all the beaches in Alicante ). It is not very well known and is not one of the top beaches in the city.\nSan Gabriel Beach\nSan Gabriel’s beach is 240m long and up to 55m wide sandy beach southwest of Alicante city centre. It is situated next to the cargo harbour’s mouth, a dry river’s estuary and a sewer drainpipe. The beach is good for calm sunbathing but just on the baseline for swimming. The water temperature ranges from a min of 18.5°C in June up to 28.2°C max in August.\nThis beach has no easy access and it is sort of forgotten by the Alicantinian council. Let’s see what makes it Special\nContents\nToggle\nServices at San Gabriel Beach\nThe San Gabriel beach is one with the shortest services list beach in Alicante. The services list is the same as in Serragrosa Beach and it is reduced to:\nRubbish bins/basic cleaning services\nCar park\nBin at San Gabriel Beach\nThere are three notorious services missing: first aid lifeguard, shower for feet and public toilets.\nThe beach is also far from shops, restaurants and chiringuitos .\nBeach Description\nSan Gabriel ‘s beach gets its name from the neighbourhood where it is situated. So it is, actually a nameless beach.\nLocation of San Gabriel in Alicante\nSan Gabriel is a southeast neighbourhood in Alicante. It is a mix of ancient houses with new apartments and flat estates.\nThe access to the beach is crossing the road N-332/Avenida de Elche crossing a pedestrian bridge. On that side of the road, there is access to the beach and to the small San Gabriel train station.\nSan Gabriel Train Station\nThe beach environment is actually calm. The harbour mouth can be an entertainment for sunbathers and the views south of the city are appealing. It is also protected from any bad weather coming north and east so only specific bad weather conditions affect San Gabriel Beach.\nThe water quality is low on the list of beaches in Alicante. San Gabriel Beach is close to the cargo harbour mouth. But also close to the mouth of the dry river “ Barranco de las Obejas “. This river gets water only during the rainy season when torrential rains happen.\nCargo port and Barranco de las Obejas Mouths from San Gabriel Beach\nIf this closeness to potential sources of dirtiness is not enough, there is a sewerage pipe releasing water into the area. Alicante follows all the European regulations regarded dark water release so dirty water gets cleaned and is not an issue… usually. Sometimes, if there are heavy rains or other types of engineering setbacks some dirty water can be released ( this article in Spanish is an example ).\nThe Sand At San Gabriel Beach\nThe beach is sandy, surprisingly, of better quality than other more famous beaches such as La Almadraba . But there is still a gap with the sand quality of other top beaches such as El Postiguet or San Juan .\nSan Gabriel Beach\nThe sand maintenance is more basic than on other more recognised beaches. That means it is clean but with more natural dirtiness such as Pelotas de Mar (or sea balls made from the rest of Neptune grass or Posidonia oceanic fibre).\nHow to Get to San Gabriel Beah?\nSan Gabriel beach address is: Av de Elche, 92, 03008 Alicante, Spain\nThe beach is isolated by the N-332 also called Avenida de Elche . And there is a pedestrian bridge to access it from the neighbourhood of San Gabriel .\nPedestrian bridge to cross to San Gabriel Beach and Train Station\nSan Gabriel Beach by Car\nThere is a tiny car park with 4 or 5 spaces in front of the beach, that can be accessed from the N-322 to Alicante centre.\nIt is probably easier to try parking the car around the San Gabriel neighbourhood. The downside is that there are not many private car parks underground and the neighbourhood gets quite packed with cars all year round.\nHere is the exact location of the car park:\nSan Gabriel Beach by Public Transport\nThe beach is not very well communicated by public transport. But there is the possibility of getting the train from Alicante’s train station or the bus to San Gabriel .\nTrain to San Gabriel from Alicante’s Train Station\nThe train line C1 to Murcia goes from Renfe Alicante to San Gabriel beach and the journey takes about 10 min.\nTrain to San Gabriel (and Murcia)\nThe downside of the train to San Gabriel is that the service is not designed for this short journey so Renfe’s website doesn’t offer it to buy online. Also, the price might be higher than the bus.\nBus to San Gabriel Beach\nAs it happens with the train, there is a bus line that stops at San Gabriel but the price schema is not designed for this trip. It is the airport bus line C6 Alicante to Alicante airport and there is all the information you need by clicking over this sentence.\nThe issue with the airport bus line is that the price is higher than just getting an urban red bus, 3.85€ vs. 1.45€. But we have traditional buses going to San Gabriel with stops close to the beach. All the info about urban bus transport in Alicante is here.\nThe bus going to San Gabriel is bus line 01, click over this sentence to get to Vectalia’s page for bus line 01.\nThe closest stop to San Gabriel Beach is Plaza Fester Paco Botella :\nThe price of a single bus ticket is 1.45€ which can be paid by contactless card, by cash or by bonus cards. Here is the bus line 01 timetable:\nSan Gabriel Bus Line 01 stops and schedule\nWho is San Gabriel Beach for?\nThis is a beach focused on locals living in the area. The lack of proper car park spaces or easy public transport connections, plus the location near potential sources of dirty water sinks this beach to the lower rank among the best beaches in Alicante .\nDespite the doubts about water quality it is permitted and safe to go for a swim. But no lifeguard services operate on the beach. Please, adapt your behaviour to the lack of rescue and first aid services as every single year we have to regret painful and evitable casualties on Alicante beaches (article in Spanish) .\nSan Gabriel Beach\nAn example of good use to give to this beach is sunbathing. The beach environment is calm, it doesn’t overcrowd as much as El Postiguet or other top beaches and the sand quality is good enough.\nI wouldn’t recommend this beach to casual tourists but i f you live in Alicante it might be a good beach to relax and solo tan on a calm and not overcrowded beach . Also, I would recommend to families to go with children if they live nearby.\nTips \u0026 Recomendations\nUse public transport to get to San Gabriel beach, it is difficult to park near the beach, even inside the neighbourhood\nThere are NO first-aid or rescue services, adapt to this situation and be extremely cautious\nAvoid this beach if it has been raining recently\nRemember to always use solar protection cream! The sun is the same on this beach as on any other"

    "content_text": "Urbanova Beach in Alicante at winter.\nUrbanova Beach is a very big and long sandy beach in Alicante city. It is not the most known beach yet one of the most beautiful. Perfect for families who want to be calm.\nUrbanova Beach is in the south of Alicante city. It is a 1mi(1.6km)+ long and 57yards (52m) wide sandy beach. There are plenty of parking spaces that tend to get full fast . Bus line 27 runs the route centre-Urbanova. There are restaurants but no party places so it is a good beach for families.\nLike many beaches in Costa Blanca, Urbanova gets busy during the summer but a bit less than other beaches such as El Postiguet or San Juan Beach ( Alicante has more than 10 beaches ). There is a promenade with restaurants and corner shops . The area is residential and the beach is semi-urban. Alicante has more than 10 beaches.\nContents\nToggle\nServices at Urbanova Beach\nHere is the complete list of services at Urbanova Beach :\nFoot showers\nParking\nSunbeds (paid service)\nUmbrellas (paid service)\nPublic bathrooms and changing room\nFirst Aid and Lifeguard\nAccess for reduced mobility people\nGames areas for children\nVolleyball nets\nApart from the beach services, there is a promenade with some food restaurants and shop s. The bus stops nearby the beach and the car parking area is very close as well. The lifeguard and first aid services run all the summer season.\nNorth of the Urbanova beach, in an area, called Agua Amarga , there is a dog’s beach . In the south, once the promenade is finished, there is a naturist area. More of that is below in the Tips \u0026 Recommendations section.\nThe Sand at Urbanova Beach\nMost beaches in Alicante have good quality sand but it varies from beach to beach. Urbanova is top-rated on this parameter. The sand is thin and mixed with small pieces of old shells.\nClose View of Urbanova Beach Sand\nOn this beach, it also stands out the presence of Pelotas de Mar or sea balls made from the rest of Neptune grass (or Posidonia oceanica) fibre. They are the small brown balls seen in the video. Neptune grass is an endemic Mediterranean seaweed that is a sample of good underwater health. The sea balls are found on many of Alicante’s beaches but Urbanova stands out in the presence of these balls.\nHow to get to Urbanova Beach in Alicante?\nUrbanova Beach is situated 5mi (8km) in the south of Alicante city centre. The address is Calle Guitarrista José Tomás, 1, 03008 Urbanova, Alicante .\nIt is easy to get by car. The parking spaces get full quickly but it is possible to find parking a bit further from the beach.\nThere is one bus available, line 27, that makes the route from Alicante-centre to Alicante-Urbanova Beach. The frequency is 40min or less.\nTo Urbanova Beach in Alicante by Bus\nBus line 27 starts at Oscar Espla 23 , next to the train station. You can then ask the driver to notify you when you have arrived at Urbanova Beach. The two best stops to get off are Carretera del Saladar and Urbanova and Carretera del Saladar Urbanova V .\nOne adult’s price is 1’45€ . Buses in Alicante accept cards, bundle cards or cash payments ( except for the airport bus C-6 ) and will accept notes up to 10€ . You can still pay with 20€ notes but you will get a paper to get your cashback in the bus company (Vectalias)’s offices.\nThe bus frequency is up to 40 min in summer. Depending on what shift you are taking, the bus might do a longer or shorter route. It is a good idea to check the bus line 27 website for more information. Google Maps has got the bus stops right but it, usually, messes up with the times so it is a good idea to check the website.\nTo Urbanova Beach in Alicante by Car\nThe car is probably the easiest way to get to Urbanova Beach . The area is residential and the streets have many parking areas. There is one clearing used as parking at the beginning of Urbanova Beach. Its address is Ctra. Saladar, 2, 03008 Urbanova, Alicante .\nParking at Urbanova Beach\nAnother advantage for drivers is that the parking areas are free of charge.\nTo Urbanova Beach in Alicante by Taxi and Cabify\nThe last option to get to Urbanova is by taxi or Cabify . The former is a Uber-like app that you can install from this link to get a discount on your first ride. Here are some indicative prices of each alternative to get to Urbanova Beach:\nOrigin Taxi Cabify Alicante-Luceros 13€ 14€ Alicante-San Juan Beach 23€ 30€ Alicante Airport N/A 12€ Elche N/A 32€ Taxi/Cabify Prices to Urbanova Beach\nThere is more extensive information about how to get a taxi or Cabify in the post about Uber in Alicante .\nTips \u0026 Recommendations\nAs we said earlier, Urbanova Beach is 1mi(1.6km) long. This beach is similar to San Juan Beach in the sense that the same single beach has different names depending on what municipality lies that beach is part of. The actual length of the beach is around 4.43mi (7km) .\nNot all the length of this beach is Urbanova. The beach is part of Alicante and part of Elche. It has different names depending on the exact location and it has different uses such as dog beach and naturist beach.\nThe Different Names on Urbanova Beach\nAgua Amarga: The Dog’s Beach\nAt the south of Alicante centre and right to the north of Urbanova, there is a beach called Agua Amarga (literally Bitter Water). Since 2016 has been the dog’s beach in Alicante. It features some dog’s special settings such as specific bins for the dog’s droppings or a fenced area that pets can use as a toilet. Here is the link to the Goole Maps beach location .\nPlaya de Los Saladares: The Naturist Beach\nRight at the end of Urbanova’s promenade , there is the beginning of the naturist beach. Here is the location in Google Maps. It is between Urbanova Beach (Alicante) and El Altet Beach (Elche). The change is negligible and you will never know the exact point where the beach changes names.\nAs you already know, the dress code on this beach is naked and some people will be offended by seeing people staying in swimming clothes.\nThis part of the beach is extremely beautiful as it is part of a natural reserve with natural sand dunes.\nEl Altet Beach: The Begining of Elche\nElche is Alicante’s neighbour town and municipality. The part of the beach called El Altet depends on Elche’s city hall and administration and money. The beach has Lifeguards and other essential services.\nGetting to this part of the beach is a bit more complicated as there are no direct public services from Alicante.\nUrbanova is Near By the Airport\nThe beach is very close to the airport. The landing track is pointing straight to Urbanova. The planes will pass a bit near the beach. Some days, depending on where is the wind coming from, it is possible to listen to the planes landing or taking off from the beach.\nUnderstanding the Beach Flags Codes\nUrbanova has the Blue Flag award. The criteria for obtaining the flag are water quality, environmental information, safety features and services. This ensures that the beach is safe and enjoyable. The flag can be seen from the beach.\nAs well there are other flags raised by the Lifeguards that are very important to understand and follow. They have 3 colours that will be repeated along the beach:\nGreen flag : Getting into the water is permitted and safe . Be always cautious.\nYellow flag : Getting into the water is permitted with limitations . You should always be able to touch the ground when standing.\nRed flag : Getting into the water is not permitted .\nThe reasons why the lifeguards will raise one or another flag are variated. The weather conditions, the presence of jellyfish or other animals or the water quality are examples. It is extremely important to follow the flags as not doing so can be life-threatening and punishable.\nWho is Urvanoba Beach for?\nThe beach is semi-urban, not so well connected by public transport and in a calm area. There are no party pubs nearby but it is easy to find food restaurants.\nOn this beach, there will be a bit fewer people than on other beaches such as El Postiguet or San Juan . As it is more difficult to get there there will be fewer groups of teenagers or very young people. The beach atmosphere is calmer and many families choose it because of that.\nCommon Sense Advice\nThe bath area is up to the yellow buoys. Don’t trespass that line .\nThe sun is dangerous, always use sunscreen cream .\nKeep your stuff safe . Thief operates the beaches.\nDrink a lot of water . Remember it will be very hot.\nAlways follow lifeguards recommendations .\nRelated Questions\nIs Urbanova beach clean? The beach is clean and well maintained throughout the year.\nIs Urbanova Beach safe? The bath on the beach is safe and watched by the lifeguards. Always keep your belongings monitored.\nCan I drink alcohol on the beach? Drinking alcohol is not permitted on the beach.\nCan I smoke on the beach? Smoked is permitted as long as cigar butts are not thrown into the sand.\nHow can I recognise a lifeguard? Lifeguards in Alicante wear a yellow T-shirt and red trousers and, usually, a red cap. Many times they will have an orange float on their hands."

Drive-in cinemas in Spain are not popular and in Muchamiel, Alicante there are one of the very few you can find in all Spain. Welcome to the Drive-in Cinema Autocine El Sur .\nDrive-in Cinema Autocine El Sur\nDrive-in cinemas are not common in Spain. The newspaper El Pais says there are only 7 drive-in cinemas in all the country and few of them don’t even open during all the year. In Alicante province we have a couple, being Autocine El Sur the best prepared.\nContents\nToggle\nWhere and How is the Drive-in Cinema\nAutocine El Sur is translated into Drive-in Cinema The South . It is situated in Muchamiel, Alicante , just about 6.2mi (10km) away from Alicante city centre. The best way to go is by car.\nThe place is a small hill itself.

You will be able to catch a FM frequency for listening to the movies from inside the card.\nDuring summer many people will get beach cheers and tables and sit in front of the car. They will probably prepare some food and popcorn to eat. If not, you can buy burgers and drinks from the bar. You will be listening to the movie wiht the speakers are distributed along all the area\nEven if in Alicante it is super hot during the night in summer and you wear shorts and t-shirts 24/7, you should really get a jacket if you want to watch a movie outside the car. It is amazing how temperatures drops when you go a bit away from the sea and the cities.\nThe Films\nThe drive-in cinema Autocine el Sur will always show 2 movies in a row. They really catch up with brand new movies that are launched in traditional cinemas but charging like if you were going to watch only one movie on a traditional cinema.\nDepending on the period of the year the starting show time will change. In summer they need to start a bit later so it gets dark enough to have a good image quality when using the projector. In winter they will start earlier so you can go home after watching the two movies.\nIf you want to know about the films, the schedule, the price, location and everything else you can go to their website and their Facebook page . They do have a twitter as well.\nI hope you learnt something cool in this article. If you have been to the drive-in cinema or you have any question, please, leave a comment!"

    "content_text": "Santa Barbara Castle is the most iconic tourist attraction in the city of Alicante . Not only because of a history that started 1000 years ago, a face that is drawn on the rock or the omnipresence of the fortification around the city. It is also the best free point to enjoy the landscape of the city, the Mediterranean Sea and the surroundings of Alicante . An easy way to get up to Santa Barbara castle is using the lift but is it not the only one.\nSanta Barbara Castle from Gran Sol\nThere are four main ways to get to the Castle : by lift , walking , by bus or by car. The castle is on the top of Benacantil Hill and it is a steep uphill of 544 feet or 166 meters. Santa Barbara Castle itself has plenty of uphill and downhill slopes to move you around its eras of history and beauty.\nEach of the access ways has advantages and disadvantages. Alicante gets extremely sunny and hot in summer. Therefore it is important to factor in your fit condition, temperature, and tolerance to the heat and the sun as your available time for the visit. All this to have the best experience visiting the medieval fortification.\nContents\nToggle\nContent\nGet Up Santa Barbara Castle By Lift\nGet Up Santa Barbara Castle By Car\nGet Up Santa Barbara Castle By Bus\nSanta Barbara Castle Opening Times\nTickets for Santa Barbara Castle\nTips for Planning Your Visit to Santa Barbara Castle\nAlicante’s Castle Legends: La Cara del Moro\nWays to Go Up to Castillo de Santa Barbara in Alicante\nThere are 4 main ways to visit the castle: Using the lift, on foot, by bus and by car. It is also possible to use the touristic bus of Alicante or Taxi/Cabify .\nGet up to Santa Barbara Castle by Lift\nThe lift is the easiest way to get into the castle if you don’t have a car or you don’t want to use public transport. It is also the less tiring way up as you don’t need to hike to the Benacantil hill up to the castle. This would be the recommended access for the last fit people or families . The entrance to the lift is located right in front of Postiguet Beach :\nThe elevator in Santa Barbara Castle has a sad tradition of closures due to technical issues or, most recently the COVID pandemic. The best way to be sure it is open is to talk to Consejeria de Turismo (Tourism Council) and ask them. Info on how to contact them is written below.\nEntrance to the Santa Barbara castle’s lift\nThe access to the castle is free but the lift service is not. The Santa Barbara lift price is 2.70€ to pay by card or cash. The lift service opening hours are the same as the fortress. The last lift-up is 40 minutes before the castle’s closing time and the last lift-down is 20 minutes before.\nAccess Santa Barbara Castle by Foot\nCastles have usually one single entrance and Santa Barbara is not an exception. There is one single door that cars, busses and pedestrians can use but there are several ways to get up to the castle on foot. The walk is actually the most picturesque way to get to the top of Benacantil Hill. This is the way to enjoy the traditional houses of the Santa Cruz neighbourhood and enjoy the views of Ereta Park .\nViews from La Ereta Park\nI leave here a pinpoint to one of the several doors the Ereta park has. If you follow this GPS mark you will need to walk through the traditional Santa Cruz neighbourhood to reach the door, which is also a must in Alicante city. Be ready for steeps, uphills and heat if it is summer. But the views and the area are just stunning.\nAnother beautiful option to get to the castle entrance is a walk through the medieval fort wall. This last pinpoint brings you to the beginning of the wall. And will get you straight to the door of the castle.\nOnce you are in Ereta Park it is easy to get around and find the castle. You just need to keep going up. Having the fortification in front of you, the entrance to the castle will be somewhat to the left .\nThe Ereta park has drinking water fountains and there is a beautiful restaurant called initially Restaurante La Ereta . Check their website if you want to have lunch or dinner there.\nThe actual castle door is outside the park. Once you are on the top left side of the Ereta you will find another Ereta park door. Outside the park, you find the car access road to the castle and about 100 meters from there the castle entrance itself. That’s your way in.\nAccess Santa Barbara Fort by Car\nThere is a road to go up to the castle but access to the castle’s parking lot is forbidden to maintain the monument in good shape.\nOne option to consider is using a taxi or Cabify as they can drive you to the castle doors.\nIf you still want to use your own car or motorbike there is also a public parking lot halfway up to the castle. It is less than 5 minutes from the fortification entrance but it is a steep way up and the castle itself is also quite steeped.\nPlease, keep in mind you need to be moderately fit for the walk as other options such as the lift or bus get you closer to the castle’s top. Parking lots also can get quite busy at peak times and don’t have many parking spots.\nSanta Barbara Castle’s Parking Lot is Situated Halfway to the Top at Night\nThe last option is to park at Ereta ‘s parking lot. It is also situated halfway to the castle entrance as it is 30 seconds away from the previous parking but it is even smaller so it can get very busy very fast.\nThese two are the closest options to park near the monument at Mount Benacantil. There are also parking spaces inside the castle but have been closed for a few years in a conservation effort to keep the historic castle fit for future visitors. The parking lot inside the castle is not set to reopen.\nUse Bus and Public Transport to Santa Barbara Castle\nThe bus line CSB goes up to Santa Barbara Castle.

Several smaller companies are organising private visits also. The easiest way to find the tours is to go to the freetour.com website and find the tour that suits you.\nSanta Barbara Castle Square and buildings\nIndependent companies use freetour.com as a platform to get exposure to tourists. They use Free Tours to announce the tours they are organising and find the customers. Sometimes they use the platform to manage payments, but not always. Many tours are free. At the end of the tour, the guide asks for remuneration that is not mandatory to give. Many times, the tourist can choose the money given to the guide.\nFind the Balance Between your Cardio and the Best Views of Alicante City\nA good tip to visit the castle might be to use the lift to go up and walk your way down . The castle itself is still steep and there is no way to avoid that part. But the distance you need to walk uphill if not get the elevator is substantial before you reach the fortification.\nWhen going downhill on foot you will still walk through Ereta Parc and the Santa Cruz neighbourhood both places being a must in your visit to Alicante.\nIf you feel in the fit mood and are a fit person or group I would still say it is more rewarding to go up on foot. It feels like the views get more and more amazing and impressive as you go up. Starting from above you will travel from the best to the good which feels just a bit not as impressive .\nHave a Picnic in the Castle With Alicante Views\nThe castle has a small recreation area with a couple of free-usage tables. There is also a small pub where you can order some drinks or food when it is open.\nIf the idea of spending some time eating in an old medieval fortification sounds appealing, please, plan some extra time for that.\nHave a Snack on the Castle\nThe Castle of Santa Barbara has a couple of snack bars where to have ice cream or coffee. Seating to enjoy on the top of Mount Benacantil surrounded by centuries of History sounds pretty neat.\nCheck the Lift to Santa Barbara Castle is Open to the Public\nThe lift to get up to Santa Barbara Castle has a sad tradition of breaking. It is a good idea to get in touch with the tourism council and check with them if the elevator is operating. Contact details are below.\nHow to Get in Touch with the Tourism Council On Alicante’s Castle Information\nConsejeria de Turismo is a public entity to help visitors to move around Alicante. They are the people to get in touch with to get the last-minute details about the castle timetable if the lift is operating or about guided visits organised by them.

There is one extended legend around the meaning of the face.\nOnce upon a time, in Muslim times, the Arab governor lived in the castle that crowns Mount Benacantil with his beautiful daughter Zahara.\nAs the princess grew older, her beauty grew, and her father was eager to find her a husband. But that was not going to be easy, since the princess did not want to get married, so the caliph organized a great party attended by her main suitors.\nThe party was a success in attendance, but among so many people a boy slipped in who was not invited, a Christian who happened to be the son of the main enemy of the Muslim leader. Zahara and the Christian boy saw each other at the party and fell in love, and although they knew that their love could not have a future, they met secretly. Their love was so great that they planned to run away together, but before they could do so, they captured the boy and sentenced him to die.\nZahara became sick of love and did not want to drink or eat. Seeing her in this situation, her father thought of a possible solution to end the suffering of her daughter. He would show her that if Alicante woke up dyed white the next day, he would forgive the person her daughter loved and give her permission to live her life with him. But if not, she would have to accept her fate and marry one of her Arab suitors.\nShe had no choice but to accept her father’s proposal and trust that she could fulfil what her father had exposed. It must be said that Alicante is a city where it rains an average of 37 days a year and it never snows.\nWell, the next day Alicante woke up dyed white, not because of snow, but because the almond trees were in bloom. A beautiful print with which Zahara felt that nature had sided with her love. Seeing the landscape, she ran towards her father’s rooms, but on the way she found a moving body in the highest part of the castle.\nHer father had broken his promise and executed him. Desperate from the situation, she decided to commit suicide by throwing herself from the top of Mount Benacantil.\nFaced with this bleak situation, her father prayed to Allah asking for the greatest punishment for what had happened. Allah decided to “petrify” him and leave his face on the hillside where his daughter fell, setting an example that what she promises must be fulfilled. That is why we now call this profile of the mountain, La Cara del Moro -or the Moor’s Face-.\nThe Moor Face Seen from El Postiguet Beach\n(adaptation of the legend from sendasyleyendas.com , in Spanish)\nAlicante has two Castles: Santa Barbara and San Fernando\nThe city of Alicante is a very hilly town that has grown around the seaside and the hills. The most important mountain is El Benacantil , which accommodates Castillo de Santa Barbara . This iconic citadel has been the foremost important element for the growth of Alicante. Remember it dates from the 9th century.\nSan Fernando and Santa Barbara Castles\nBack then, long walls prolonged up to Postiguet Beach protecting the city and its citizens. Around the city, some ruins are remembering those times. As the city’s safety, protection needs and war techniques involved the walls were retired so the city could keep growing.\nMost recently in history, around the year 1813, the Peninsular War (UK, Spain and Portugal VS the Napoleonic France ) required special military set-ups and Castillo de San Fernando was built as a prison on the top of Monte Tossal .\nSan Fernando Castle is another place to enjoy the views of Alicante if you have time enough. In Tossal Hill you can also find one of the public swimming pools in Alicante .\nCasatillo de Santa Barbara is Part of Alciante’s Identity\nThe monument is the most visited place in the city. It has been part of the city almost since its creation and has shaped its growth. It has been destroyed and rebuilt several times in history. Alicante counted 337482 inhabitants in the last 2020 census.\nThe citadel has several popular legends around it and it is a charismatic castle. From several places in the city, you can observe what Alicantinians call “The face of the moor”. Rocks shape what resembles a face when you see the castle from certain points, such as Playa del Postiguet .\nThe legend tells a love story from the times when the city was under Muslim control and there is a reason why the Muslim caliph got into the rock forever, you might want to do a tour to know more!\nFor many years the castle has been illuminated at night as a monument. It is a reference point from several places in Alicante or around Alicante. For example, it is easy to identify from far away when in a car on the motorway, on a boat at sea or flying in a plane . Nowadays the castle also counts with LED illumination that can set different colours as many other monuments in other cities.\nRelated Questions\nIs Santa Barbara Castle free?

    "content_text": "Tabarca Island is part of the city of Alicante situated 20km (12mi) south of Alicante Port. It is a small island with a beach, coves, restaurants, nature, historic buildings, a small traditional town and shops. It is the only inhabited island in the region. The area has a natural value as it is one of the few marine nature reserves in Spain with an explosion of sea plants and sea fish species in the area.\nTabarca Island views of an old door and port entrance\nIs Tabarca Island worth visiting? Yes. The island deserves a day trip to enjoy its cosy charisma. Your day will be filled with a mix of adventure -you will need to travel by ferry or speed dinghy-, quality traditional gastronomy, beautiful beach and coves and walks at places filled with centuries of history.\nThere are several points to have in mind when planning your trip so it becomes a memorable quality experience. Tips on how to get to Tabarca Island, the traditional dishes original from the island, some enigmatic places to visit and the story behind the island are down here. Therefore, you can play your day in Tabarca and make the most of it.\nContents\nToggle\nContent\nPlan your Day in Tabarca\nTabarca ferry – How to get to Tabarca\nWhat traditional food to eat in Tabarca (and where)\nWhat to See and Do in Tabarca\nTabarca Beach (and Coves)\nHow to Plan a Day in Tabarca\nVisiting Tabarca needs some planning. The trip is somehow special and probably will fell you tired at the end of the day. You will be sailing to the island, eating in one of their amazing restaurants, spending time outdoors under the sun, going to the beach if it is summer, doing some snorkelling, walking around the traditional old town…\nAll these activities will use most of the time of your day.\nSo there are a few things to have in account when planning your visit:\nIs your budget enough to eat traditional dishes in one of their restaurants?\nDo you get dizzy when sailing?\nAre you going to spend time on the beach?\nDo you want to spend the night in Tabarca watching the stars or doing some special nautical activities?\nDecide on Your Transport\nThe first thing to organise is the ferry/speed boat to Tabarca. The most adventurous might want to buy an experience on a jet ski or sailing bout. Most people will use one of the ferries from Alicante, Santa Pola, Torrevieja or even Benidorm as the experience is less intense but very convenient.\nThere is more information on ferries to Tabarca below.\nPrepare for a Long Day\nOnce you have decided on how to get to the island it is important that you plan your day outdoors.\nThink Again About the Sailing Trip\nThe first thing you need to think a bit more about is the sailing trip. Ferries or speed bouts from Santa Pola take from 15 to 25 minutes per trip. The journey from Alicante, Benidorm or Torrevieja is longer. If you are a person who gets dizzy easily there are some drugs you can get from the pharmacy. Investigate Viodramina con cafeina and ask the pharmacist about it. Viodramina makes you sleepy, the caffeine will wake you up so you get the anti-dizziness effect but not the drowsiness.\nIf you tend to feel a bit sick during a road trip or on buses, then this advice is especially good for you.\nYou Will Spend Many Hours Under the Sun\nThere are not many places to settle in Tabarca, some restaurants have an indoor saloon but most of them have also outdoor terraces with awnings. In summer it can get very hot so be sure you bring water, solar protection cream and sunglasses. If you are going for a swim (truly recommended if you go in summer) be sure you prepare for that also. So here is the list of essentialities to bring on your trip to Tabarca:\nWater\nSolar protection cream\nSunglasses, hats\nSwimming clothes, and towels for the beach if summer\nCash money in case some restaurants don’t get a card\nIn Tabarca there are public (and free) toilets, in front of the beach. Restaurants also have private toilets. You can easily get changed there. Also, Tabarca Island has the only beach in Alicante with showers for the full body instead of foot showers like other beaches in Alicante such as El Postiguet or San Juan .\nFood and Restaurants\nThe last thing to have in mind is food. It is worth eating in one of the restaurants in Tabarca. Prices are higher than in mainland Alicante but some dishes are traditional from the island. The traditional dishes are mainly based on fish but there are also vegetarian options, for example, in most places they can prepare fully vegetarian Arroz (in Alicante Arroces are prepared instead of Paella, being a similar dish but with distinctive nuances in its preparation).\nMost restaurants will accept cash and the mobile internet works fine but having some cash in case things fail is a good idea.\nThe traditional dish is Caldero de Gallina . It consists of a first plate based on fish and the second plate of Arroz . There are other many options such as salads, Arroces de verduras (vegetarian), Spanish omelettes and many others, just like in traditional restaurants in the centre of Alicante.\nTabarca has many restaurants around its town but in summer it can get extremely busy. An option is to book your food before going to the island, some ferry companies offer bundles with food at the restaurants booked and paid in advance. The peak time is usually at Spanish lunchtime, somewhere between 1 pm and 4 pm.\nAlso, remember that you can bring your own food if you want to save money.\nPlan an Adventure\nTabarca doesn’t need to be sort of tranquil. There are many other activities you can do. Here are some ideas:\nPlan a snorkelling activity, more about snorkelling in Tabarca on snorkelingthings.com’s article\nOrganise scuba a diving immersion\nJet ski trip\nSailing boat trip\nPaddle surf\nKayaking\nParasailing\nSuper speedy boat trip\nYou Can also Sleep in Tabarca\nThere are few hotels on the island. Ferry companies such as Kontiki (transfer from Alicante) allow using the return ticket any other day. There are several reasons why you would like to sleep in Tabarca.\nMaybe you want to do a small retreat during the low season. Or practice some water sports, such as snorkelling, for a longer time in summer.\nRecently, Tabarca Island has been chosen as a Starlight site . This means it is one of the best places in Spain to watch the stars at night. As the island is a bit far from the coast and big cities there is a clear sky for star sighting. The organisation Starlight has support from the International Astronomical Union (IAU) and UNESCO, which approves the certificates issued by Starlight. So this is another perfect reason to sleep at the isle.\nA few hostels and/or hotels you could check for your stay at Tabarca are Hostal Nueva Tabarca , Hotel Boutique Isla de Tabarca , Cala Tabarca or Casa La Trancada .\nHow to Go to Tabarca Island\nLet’s start with the ways of not going to the island. Every year there is a race where people go swimming but these are professional swimmers accompanied by rescue dinghies so don’t try it on your own. Another bad idea is to use bouts such as kayaks as the distance from the coast to Tabarca island is 8km (5mi). In addition, the sea is not always calm and the wind and maritime conditions can change quickly. So do not try kayaking either.\nSo the way to go to Tabarca is by ferry or speed boat.\nThere are several cities with regular ferry services to Tabarca. Santa Pola is the central hub as the distance to the island is only 8km (5mi). To the centre of Alicante, Tabarca is 20km (12mi) away. Services from Benidorm or Torrevieja are also available depending on the year’s season. Hint: the cheapest service is from Santa Pola by Speed Boat Taxi.\nFerry Company From Time to Tabarca Price Kontiki Alicante 45-60 min 21€ return Tabarkeras Santa Pola 20 min 12€ return Speed Bouts Santa Pola 15 min from 15€ return Excursiones Maritimas Benidorm Benidorm A few hours as it stops in Alicante 35€ return Ferry Torrevieja-Tabarca Torrevieja 60 min 24€ return Ferries (and ticket prices) going to Tabarca\nAlicante-Tabarca Ferry\nThe company operating the Alicante-Tabarca Ferry is called Kontiki. They have a set price for the trip on any of their ships. The fee (20 €) is usually set for a return trip. A one-way trip takes from 45 to 60 minutes. During the winter season, they have fewer services than in summer or no services at all. On their Kontiki web page , there is a schedule with the ferries going to Tabarca Island.\nKontiki Bouts At Alicante’s Port\nThe company Kontiki also has other services than Tabarca Ferries. They are available for private hire, to see the Hogueras de San Juan fireworks from the sea or the Ocean Race Reggata starting from Alicante’s port.\nKontiki has a few boats docked at Alicante’s port. All of them are catamarans (bouts with two parallel hulls) so they are a little bit less prone to swing than traditional ships. Some have also subaquatic vision, with glasses that allow them to see the sea bottom.\nSubaquatic Vision Ferry\nHow to Book Kontiki Ferry Tickets Alicante-Tabarca\nThere are a couple of ways to buy the Kontiki Ferry ticket to Tabarca.\nUsing their website .\nGoing to their offices at Alicante’s port.\nThe price is 20€ return. In case you choose to sleep on the island (more about that above) the return ticket can be used any other day. The distance that separates the city port from the island port is 12mi (12 km) so the journey takes a bit longer than from Santa Pola.\nAlso, it is important to know that the Kontiki company usually cease operations for a few months in winter. If you plan your trip during the winter season and the Kontiki website shows no services the alternative is to find a different transport company, such Tabarkeras which operates from Santa Pola-Tabarca.\nKontiki Tabarca Website, Address and Phone Numbers\nWebpage to Book Tickets: https://cruceroskontiki.com/en/\nContact Phone numbers: +34 686994540 / +34 695212063 / +34 686994539\nAddress: Passeo Maritimo de la Libertad, S/N, 03002 Alicante, España\nSanta Pola-Tabarca Ferry\nThe ferry from Santa Pola takes less time than from Alicante, just 25 min, as the distance to Tabarca is only 8km (5mi). The ferry company operating the service is Tabarkeras . A return trip cost 12€.\nTravelling from Alicante to Santa Pola can be inconvenient. There are buses operating from Alicante Bus Station to Santa Pola . The cost is economical, only 2.40€ but the frequency is low so you need to plan it. Check the bus tickets to Santa Pola at Movelia’s website. Another option is to use the Spanish Uber-like app (as Uber doesn’t operate in Alicante) or a traditional taxi . But these two options are more expensive.\nOn the Tabarkeras ferry website , there is available the timetable, prices, ship description, information about Tabarca Island, other services they offer, etc.\nAt Tabarkeras, the ferries are orange, catamaran shaped and most of their bouts have underwater vision with glasses in their hulls.\nBook Santa Pola-Tabarca ferry (Tabarkeras)\nThere are two ways to book tikes for the ferry from Santa Pola to Tabarca:\nThe first option is calling to Tabarkeras’ number +34 608 962 266\nOr at Tabarkeras office at Santa Pola Port\nTabarkeras docket at the harbour in Santa Pola\n8km (5mi) is what separates Santa Pola Port from Tabarca Port.

Traditional day trip services have also a stop in Alicante before going to the island.\nThey use a fast blue catamaran called SEA WORLD .\nTorrevieja-Tabarca Ferry\nTorrevieja has ferry services to the isle during the summer season. This is the website of the company operating the route.\nThey use a fast white trimaran (3 hulls) with services depending on the demand. Their phone number is +34 966 70 21 22\nTo Tabarca by Speed Bout Taxi\nStarting from Santa Pola there are several companies with Taxi services to Tabarca. The bouts they operate are smaller speed bouts or small catamarans. They can be cheaper than Tabarkeras or Kontiki, they also launch offers every now and then.\nThey are sometimes more flexible on timetables, being able to adapt the schedule to big groups of people or offer different bundle activities such as Tabarca transport + lunch, Tabarca transport + snorkelling, etc\nThe tickets can be booked on their websites or at Santa Pola port. Here is a list of some of the speed bout companies:\nTabarbus (Red Bouts)\nTabarca Water Taxi (Yellow Bouts)\nTransbarca (Blue Bouts)\nThese bouts are usually smaller and faster than big catamarans. The journey might take as little as 15 minutes and the sailing experience might be more intense than in bigger bouts.\nAlternatives Ways to Travel to Tabarca\nThere are also different ways to go to Tabarca Island. For example, there are companies renting bouts for people with sailing licences or organising trips to Tabarca on a jet ski or sailing bouts. Another option is joining an organised trip with the restaurant included in the price or snorkelling or swimming.\nDuring the summer, the island gets a lot of bouts visiting the natural maritime reserve. May bouts cast the anchor in front of the island’s main beach every year, making it a very enigmatic place to enjoy time with your friends. Some restaurants even deliver food to anchored bouts.\nWhat to See and Do in Tabarca\nTabarca is a beautiful island with a lot of history and heritage. There are several old buildings and places that are worth visiting. Some are on land and other places are in the water to enjoy in summer.\nVisit Tabarca Beach and Coves\nIn Tabarca there is a beach filled with hold sand. Just as in Alicante mainland (remember Tabarca is a neighbourhood of Alicante) the city hall maintains it clean and safe.\nThe beach on Tabarca Island in Alicante\nThe beach has all the services you would expect, such as lifeguards, public toilets, cleaning services, hammock rentals, etc.\nBut the official beach is not the only place where you can go swimming. The island has several coves and rocky corners where to go for a swim and snorkelling. One famous is the cove Birros i la Guàrdia . It is beautiful, good for snorkelling and directed at the open sea.\nCove in Tabarca (Birros i la Guàrdia)\nIt is situated in front of Tabarca’s town, leaving Spain’s mainland on your back.\nBut this is not the only place where you can go swimming in Tabarca. The best advice is to walk around the island and choose a place you like. Note something thought: Seagulls.\nSeagulls in Tabarca\nThe Island of Tabarca is a marine reserve. It means there are heavy restrictions on fishing and what can be done in the reserve. Seagulls have a heavy presence on the island and they are very territorial animals. If you get too close to areas they have nests they will start flying in circles above you. If the seagulls feel you are a threat chances are they will start flying towards you, getting quite close.\nA beach in Tabarca where many seagulls have nests\nGood advice is not to go down the beaches where seagulls are, or swim on rocks with many of these birds. Walking around the set paths on the island is perfectly fine.\nEat the Traditional Caldero (or Arroz as Veggy Option)\nEach region in Spain, even each city, has its own traditional food. In Tabarca Island, the most traditional dish is Caldero . It consists of two separate plates, one based on fish and the other based on rice.\nMost restaurants in Tabarca cook Caledero . You can go around the town and sit at the restaurant you like the most.\nEven though Caldero is the most traditional dish in Tabarca is not the only option for restaurants. If you are a vegetarian, another traditional dish is Arroz de Verduras (which means vegetable rice). This dish is traditional in Alicante. It is similar to paella, made in the same pan, but with some nuances that make it special from Alicante.\nVeggy Arroz for two people in Tabarca\nBut if you are not convinced with any of these dishes, do not worry, there are many other options such as salads, Spanish omelettes and many other dishes available.\nWalk Around The Traditional Town\nTabarca is the smallest inhabited island in Spain. The small town is called de San Pedro y San Pablo and it is protected by old fortification walls. There are many old doors around all Tabarca’s town.\nOne of the many wall doors in Tabarca\nA walk around the island’s town is a comeback to the past. There is a church, also called “ Iglesia de San Pedro y San Pablo “. It was inaugurated in 1779 but is usually closed to the public.\nDe San Pedro y San Pablo Church\nThere are small islands next to the main Tabarca Isle. Some of them are accessible only by sea, but others are disconnected from the main island by waters that are not deep.\nThe small island next to the main Tabarca island\nSome people cross from the main island to the smaller one in summer but is not recommended. If the sea conditions change, and they can change fast, you will have a hard time going back.\nFind the Cross on the Rock in Tabarca\nAt the very east end of Tabarca, there is a Christian cross on the top of a rock separated from mainland Tabarca by the sea.\nCross on the Rock in Tabarca\nIt is situated at the end of the old orchard on the island. On your way there you will find Tabarca’s lighthouse, the cemetery and other old buildings such as La Torre de San José, built in 1790.\nVisit The Museum In Tabarca\nThe city of Alicante has plenty of museums that tell the story and hold heritage from the city and province of Alicante. Since was to be expected, there is also a Museum in Tabarca.\nThe museum has two showrooms to dive into the island’s heritage and ecological value.

    "content_text": "Alicante might look like a possible destination for your holidays, business or even your new home. Let’s find out where Alicante is in Europe and within Spain.\nWhere is Alicante? Alicante City is on the southeastern coast of Spain (Europe). Next to the Mediterranean Sea (and the beach ), it has 320 days of sun per year .\nLocation of Alicante in Spain\nThe Weather in Sunny Alicante\nTransport in Alicante\nAlicante is 260.41 mi (419.1 km) southeast of the Spanish capital city Madrid ( 2h20m away by speed train AVE ). It is situated 326.46 mi (525.4 km) in the south of Barcelona ( 1h by plane ). Alicante is a the capital of Costa Blanca . It is the capital of Alicante Province , the southernmost province of the Valencian Community. The coordinates are 38°20′43″N 0°28′59″W\nThe Spanish administrative division is somehow complex. Each city is located inside a wider structure that organises the country. Sometimes the structures are official and recognised by law but other times the division will be used as a brand or will be part of the popular knowledge.\nContents\nToggle\nThe Exact Location of Alicante In Spain\nAlicante Province is a wider and lawful administrative division. It is located at the south of the province of Valencia, at the north of the province of Murcia, at the east of the province of Albacete and the west of the Mediterranean Sea. In Spain, there is a total of 50 provinces. Cities such as Alicante, Benidorm and Elche are part of this province. The city of Alicante is the capital.\nCosta Blanca (that translates to White Coast) is the name of the Alicante province coastline . It is located on the southeastern coast of Spain and it is over 125 mi (200km) long. There are several cities in Costa Blanca . The first city in the north is Denia and the last city in the south is Pilar de la Horadada . Other examples of coastal cities in Costa Blanca are Alicante, Benidorm, Javea, Denia and Torrevieja.\nThe Province of Alicante is inside of the Valencian Community . It is situated south of Catalonia, north of Murcia, east of Castilla-La Mancha, east of Aragon and west of the Mediterranean Sea. Spain has 17 Autonomous Communities which are other lawful administrative divisions in the country.\nFinally, Alicante is in Levante . This is a popular way to call the area on the Spanish eastern coast. In the north, it starts in Girona (Catalonia). In the south, we find Murcia or Almeria. Coastal cities such as Benidorm, Barcelona, Alicante, Castellon de la Plana, Lloret de Mar, Murcia or Benicassim are in Levante but not only. Other inland cities such as Elche, Jativa, Lleida, Buñol, Alcoy or Requena are in Levante as well. It is a wide area on the east coast of Spain.\nDistance Between Towns in Alicante Province and the Airport\nThe main international connection to Aliante province, Costa Blanca and, therefore, cities such as Benidorm or Calpe is Alicante Airport . The aerodrome is officially called Alicante-Elche Airport as it is in Elche’s municipality.

So if your destination is a coastal town in Costa Blanca the south of Alicante the road will be your only commuting option. There are public and private bus and taxi services operating the routes you need from the airport or Alicante .\nThe last option is to rent a car. Vehicle prices are very competitive in the area and many companies are offering their rental services. As with flights, there are few websites where you can find the cheapest deals.\nMost of the motorways in Alicante province are free and safe.

    "content_text": "Alicante is an ancient and charming Mediterranean city. A day is a little time to enjoy all of what Alicante has to offer so let’s focus on how to make the most of your time.\nAlicante Albufereta from Serra Grossa at dusk\nThere are a few things to do in Alicante that will make your time the most enjoyable possible in the city: Visits to ancient monuments, walks in between palm trees, lunch with sea views…\nContents\nToggle\nMorning (to 2 pm)\nStart your day strong. Spaniards eat “late”. Anytime from 1 pm to 3 pm and life gets easier and more yummy adapting to that lunchtime. Just choose a place nearby where you are staying and have a good breakfast.\nSometimes you will need to go out from where you are staying to have breakfast. The top areas are Mercado Central, El Barrio or bars in front of El Postiguet or Virgen del Socorro street. Do not overthink this too much, just go close to the place where you are staying and have a good breakfast.\nTypical things to eat at breakfast are toast with grated tomatoes ( Pan con Tomate in Spanish) with coffee or natural orange juice.\nSanta Barbara Castle\nOne of the top attractions in Alicante is Santa Barbara Castle and it is the perfect way to start your day. And the entrance is free! It is on the top of Mount Benacantil (544 feet or 166 meters up) so the best option is to get the lift costing a small fee. This article has all the info you need to know about Santa Barbara Castle. This is the address to the lift:\nExpected time: 1:30h to 2h\nWalk Down through La Ereta And Santa Cruz\nBe ready for more slopes. But the way down from Santa Barbara Castle is quite picturesque and worth the effort. Exit through the main exit in the castle and walk the trails to La Ereta Park. Keep down and use one of the doors in the Santa Cruz neighbourhood.\nThis little neighbourhood was originally protected by walls. The city down the castle fortification.\nOn your way down you might want to visit some of the museums around the area. For example, Aguas de Alicante -to learn how a super dry area like Alicante has been outsmarting nature on water usage for millennials-, MUBAG museum -if you like fine arts- or Maca museum if you like contemporary art.\nExpected time: about 1h to 2h visiting museums.\nLunch Time (1 pm to 3 pm)\nAt this point of your visit, it should be already around the Spanish lunchtime (1 pm to 3 pm).\nSo are you hungry after so much walking on the slopes of the Benacantil?\nLunch Time\nNow it is time to find a good restaurant to eat at. Have in mind that for the Spaniards, lunch is probably the most important meal of the day, the most abundant.\nMy favourite recommendation is to go to a skyscraper for lunch: El Gran Sol .\nThis renovated 97m tall skyscraper has an amazing restaurant on floor 26. It is the 3rd tallest building in Alicante and, probably, the one with the best views. I would recommend you book in advance as it can get busy. It is a bit more expensive than other restaurants but not in excess.\nThey have typical Alicantinian cuisine. The views from the top are astonishing.\nIf you were thinking of having tapas instead… I would leave that for dinner. Foods such as Arroz (similar to paella and cooked at Gran Sol ) are eaten by local people at lunchtime so it is better to use this opportunity for that type of meal instead of tapas.\nExpected time: about 1h to 1:30h (that’s the time Spaniards would take).\nWalk on the Explanada\nJust below the Gran Sol is La Explanada de España. This picturesque pomegranate is worthy of a walk.\nThe floor has wave shapes in a reminder of the sea of Alicante. The colours are representative of the area as the stones are from nearby mines.\nIf you didn’t have a dessert or coffee it is a perfect place to have it in one of the different cafes, ice cream shops or bars along the pomegranate.\nExpected time: from 45min to 1h.\nAfternoon – Evening (From 4 pm to 8-9 pm)\nThe recommendation will now be dependent on the day of the week. During weekdays museums like the MARQ should be open until 7 pm, except for Mondays. On weekends it closes earlier. But don’t worry if the museums are closed, there are more things to do in Alicante.\nMARQ Museum\nA good idea to use this time is to visit more museums. One of the most important museums in Alicante is the MARQ Museum. MARQ stands for Museo Arqueologico or Arqueological Museum.\nMARQ Museum Alicante with Christmas Decorations\nThe exhibition stores pieces from virtually all the cultures Alicantinian land has helped to grow and develop. There is more information about the MARQ Alicante, including opening times, in this article.\nMARQ is not in Alicante city centre so you might need to take the TRAM or the bus .\nAlternative To Museums\nIf MARQ is closed or you are simply you are tired of museums there are more options for you.\nShopping in Alicante\nThere are several shopping malls in Alicante but they look the same in every city so let’s focus on the high street.\nIn Alicante, the highstreet is Avenida de Maisonave.\nAt the west extreme is Alicante Train Station and at the east side is the Plaza Sotelo Calvo Park. But most important, on each extreme is El Corte Inglés , one of the most important department stores in Spain.\nAlso, at Avenida de Maisonave , there are many important brands such as Zara, Stradivarius, Tezenis, Breshka and Massimo Dutti as examples.\nLuceros Square\nLuceros Fountain, in Luceros Square, dating from 1930. It is one of the most important monuments in the city for its significance and its architectural value.\nIt might be worth a quick look at the fountain if you are nearby.\nCanalejas Park\nThis is a very beautiful park in Alicante. It features many centenary Ficus trees near Alicante port so it is worth walking through it.\nIt was built in 1886 and the name is in honour of a former Spanish prime minister: Jose Canalejas y Mendez .\nThe location is at the end of La Explanada :\nExpected time: 2h-3h\nNight\nAt this point, it should be around 8 pm-9 pm. Anytime from 8 pm or 8:30 pm is a good time for dinner in Spain.\nNow it is time for tapas. A good street with several tapas restaurants is “ La Calle de Las Setas ” or Mushroom Street . As soon as you are in the street you understand why it is called that way. It is here:\nMushroom Street\nAnother good area for tapas is around Mercado and also at El Barrio.\nExpected time: 1h to 2h\nParty Time\nMost Spaniards will go party from 12 pm. The party area in Alicante is El Barrio and Castaños.\nBut if you want to go to have a drink after dinner don’t worry, most of the places will be already open for you to enjoy a cocktail or a beer.\nThe clubs and most of the places in El Barrio, have to close at 4 am by law."

    "content_text": "Alicante ‘s museums are a mix of millennial archaeology, modern art and the city’s people’s culture. Alicante is a very old human settlement. The first records of human activity date from the Bronze Age, starting 5000 years ago. Part of this heritage is stored in its museums or at archaeological sites. But there is a lot more.\nMuseum at Tabarca Island\nThe city of Alicante has plenty of museums with paintings, sculptures, historical items and general culture. There are also old ruins and other heritage to visit. Some of this legacy is thousands of years old, such items stored in the MARQ museum. Many other ruins have centuries of history, such as Santa Barbara Castle . Other museums tell the story of the Ocean Race regatta or Tabarca Island , to name two examples. There is plenty to choose from, options for adults and children.\nAnother important event that left a lot of legacy in the city was the Spanish Civil War. As you can see there are many things to do in Alicante. The war ended in Alicante, on the 1st of April in 1939. Old buildings such as the air-raid shelters shaped Alicante and many other cities in Spain.\nContents\nToggle\nComplete list of Museums in Alicante:\nMARQ Museum – Archaeological Museum\nMACA Museum – Modern Art Museum\nThe Ocean Race Museum – Sailing, regatta and environment\nMUBAG Museum – Fine Arts Museum in Alicante\nAguas de Alicante and Garrigós Wells\nMUSA Museum – Alicantinian History Museum\nAlicante Air Raid Settlers – Civil War/WWII Civil Defense\nHogueras de San Juan Museum – Alciante’s Main Festivity Ninots Museum\nMARQ Museum Alicante\nMuseo Arequeologico Provincial de Alicante or Provincial Archaelogical Museum of Alicante. This is probably the most important museum in the city and province of Alicante. There is an article with a complete explanation of the MARQ museum in this article .\nMarq Museum Entrance at Christmas\nThe MARQ is an interactive museum. It has an array of permanent and temporary expositions. In the permanent rooms, there are assets from around 10000 years ago, that’s the prehistory era. Each big room covers one historical period: prehistory, Iberians, Romans, Middle Ages and contemporary culture.\nThey also have temporary expositions running. On the MARQs website , there is a list of expositions they have at each point in time. The page is not very well translated into English but all the museum explanations are written in several languages, including English.\nVisit MARQ’s Basement or Archeological Sites\nAnother experience MARQ Museum offers is a visit to archaeological sites and, even if it sounds weird, their basements.\nOn the visit to the basements, you can learn more about how the back office of the museum works. They will explain how they do the storage, restorations, sending/receiving of valuable items and more. The visit is guided and 1h long.\nIf you feel more adventurous they have visits to the actual archaeological sites where some of the items in the showrooms were found. In Alicante and Alicante province, there are several iconic archaeological sites such as Illeta dels Banyets. This small peninsula was detached from the mainland in an earthquake many years ago. But, in 1943, it was attached again to mainland Alicante and now it can be visited on foot. It is situated in the town of Campello and can be reached with TRAM line 1 , stop Poble Espanyol .\nThis is not the only site to visit but arguably the most picturesque.

It is an interactive museum where children can also have fun plus sites are open to visitors.\nHow much is a ticket for the MARQ museum?\nThe price for a single adult is 3€.

It is fulfilled by paintings and sculptures. Many extremely famous Spanish artist feature their artworks at the museum.\nMaca Museum In Alicante\nThere is an array of national artists in the Contemporary Art Museum. This is the museum in Alicante where you can find artwork from Salvador Dalí , Joan Miró , Eusebio Sempere and others.

Just in front of the door of one of the entrances to la Ereta Park. At Alicante’s old city centre.\nVisit a Cententenary Well (Garrigós Wells)\nAlicante’s inhabitants had to be very creative when it comes to water. The city is in a semi-arid area so rain is not constant or abundant.\nLuckily the mountains nearby provided some rivers and sort of constant sources of water that have been used in more recent times. During the XVI century, the excavation of the rock of Mount Benacantil for creating water wells started. On the XIX, the current Garrigós wells were built. The facilities went out of use in 1898.\nThese old man-made wells excavated on Santa Barbara ‘s castle mountain can be visited now. The entrance to the wells is inside the museum Aguas de Alicante itself. The environment is a bit cold and humid. It feels like the indoors of a cave.\nWho is Aguas de Alicante Museum for?\nAdults and children can enjoy and learn about water in this museum.

Also, Santa Barbara Castle is a must-see in Alicante that children will love as it is mainly an outdoor activity that implies exploring. In addition to this, there is always the intent of making the castle appealing to children with activities or little surprises children would love around the castle.\nEntrance to the castle and the MUSA museums are free, no tickets are needed.\nAs an important note, the expositions have the same opening time as the castle:\nFrom 15th of November to 27th of February: Monday-Sunday from 10 am to 6 pm\nFrom 28th of February to 16th of June: Monday-Sunday from 10 am to 8 pm\nFrom 17th of June to 4 of September: Monday-Sunday 10 am to 23 pm\nFrom 5th of September to 14th of November: Monday-Sunday from 10 am to 8 pm\nAlso, here is the castle’s address: Castillo de Santa Bárbara.

The Second World War took the shape of a Civil War in Spain where two bands, the Republicans and the Nationalists, fought each other.\nAlicante’s people and infrastructure were not an exception and suffered brutal and devasting consequences in this war. Alicante’s port was the last place in Spain taken by the nationalists .\nAshamedly, until that happened, Alicante was bombed several times. The, arguably, most dramatic plane bombing in Spain during the war had as the main target Mercado Central. The date was Wednesday, 25 May 1938. It happened during a busy day and I prefer not to write here about the consequences it had. Check the Wikipedia article if you want to know more.\nIn order to protect the people, shelters with a capacity of around 30000 people were built. Some of them are open to guided visits nowadays.\nVisit an Underground Air Raid Shettler\nAt the moment, there are 2 Air Raid Settlers open in Alicante under guided visits:\nOne on Seneca Square:\nAnd one on Balmis Square:\nThe tours are offered by Turiguias Alicante . On their website, they have links to book the tours in English or Spanish. An adult ticket is 5€, and children under 6 years old have free entrance. Tickets for youngsters up to 18 years old, retired people and other bonified sectors are 3€.\nThe schedule varies every week so it is better to check their website.\nCheck Out More Memories From the Civil War\nFurthermore, the city of Alicante has many other remains of the civil war. An enthralling history is about the British cargo ship Stanbrook (in Spanish) , captained by Archibald Dickson. It happened to be in Alicante to load some saffron, oranges and tobacco when the war was about to end.\nStatue honouring Stanbrook’s Captain Archibald Dickson\nEven though the cargo had arrived in Alicante’s port after a few days of waiting, Dickson decided to leave the cargo and rescue all the Spanish refugees who were waiting at the port. 10 minutes after the ship had left, Alicante suffered another bomb attack.\nIt was 27 March 1939.\nA total of 1832 people got into Standbrook. After 20 hours of travel, they arrived in Oran, situated in the French part of Argelia at the time.\nThere were a few more days and weeks until everyone was able to disembark. The story of the refugees in Oran is motley. Some ended up at internment camps in Argelia but also many had good opportunities in other countries.\nArchibald Dickson was originally from Cardiff, Wales. There is a commemorative statue at Alicante’s port with a plaque. Alicante’s city donated the same plaque to Cardiff a few years ago.\nAfter a few years exposed to the public, it was about to change location to the Pierhead building in Cardiff but the plans have been delayed by the COVID pandemic.\nWho are the Air Raid Shelters for?\nAdults who want to know more about WWII and Civil War history. Children will enjoy exploring subterranean tunnels.\nHow much is the entrance ticket to the Air Raid Shelters?\nFree for children younger than 6. 3€ up to 18, retired people and vulnerable sectors. 5€ adult ticket. Buy your ticket at Turiguias.com\nAre the Air Raid Shelters open?\nYes, check Turiguias’ website as the visit times change continuously.\nAre there guided tours to the Air Raid Shelters?\nYes, the visit to the Shelters is possible only through guided tours.\nHogueras De San Juan Museum in Alicante\nAlicante celebrates Hogueras de San Juan (San Juan Bonfires) every year from the 20th to the 24th of June. And then, there are also fireworks every night from the 25th up to the 29th of June.\nNinots at Hogueras Museum Alicante\nMost Spanish cities have a festivity celebrated yearly. Virtually always, the city hall involucres in its organisation. Many city halls in Spain have a party councillor with a budget of public money assigned.\nMany private citizens and popular associations also get involved and spend their own money on the celebrations. Some townspeople would get loans to celebrate the festivity, especially if there is a rotating position in the party’s organization.\nAs said earlier, Alicante’s main festivity is Hogueras de San Juan and the city hall and people involvement are massive.\nOther examples of city-held festivities are the Seville Fair (Feria de Abril), Los San Fermines in Pamplona and La Tomatina in Bunol to name a few examples. Alicante’s festivity is Las Hoguera de San Juan . 4 days of full parties where the streets become museums filled with gigantic sculptural bonfires. The streets become party clubs and the Spanish love for outdoor living and noise becomes obvious.\nAlicantinians have the concept of “Mascletas”. It is held every day at 2 pm in Luceros during Hogueras . It is a fireworks show… except for the fact that there are no fireworks to see as the point is to hear the noise. Massive crakers are exploited on land and air in a symphony of pure crakers’ noise.\nMassive bonfires are built and burned every year. The main structure can be as high as a 4-floor building but there are also smaller de-attached sculptures called Ninots . These are usually no higher than 2 m high. Every year, one of these small Ninots is “saved” from being burnt and given the status of “ Ninot indultado ” or pardoned Ninot in English.\nExample of Hoguera during the Bonfires Festival in June. Examples of Ninots (the statues)\nThis happens after a jury visits every bonfire around the city and decides on the most beautiful or significant Ninot sculpture to pardon. Las Hogueras de San Juan is a kind of complex festivity and neighbourhoods compete with each other on the best bonfire, Ninot, party organisation and many other categories.\nThe Ninots are stored in Las Hogueras de San Juan Museum . There are other elements to visit at the museum: traditional costumes, clips and information about the bonfire festival …\nGigantes at Hogueras Museum Alicante\nHogueras de San Juan museum opens:\nSeptember-June\nTuesday-Friday from 10 am to 2 pm and 3 pm to 6 pm\nSaturday from 10 am to 14 pm\nMonday, Sunday and bank holidays are closed\nJuly-August\nTuesday-Friday from 10 am to 2 pm and 6 pm to 9 pm\nSaturday from 10 am to 2 pm\nMonday and Sunday are closed\nThe entrance ticket is free.\nThe address is Rambla de Méndez Nuñez nº 2905003. Alicante.\nOrganise a Trip to Alicante on Hogueras de San Juan\nIf you have never been to any Spanish festivity, San Juan Bonfires might be like something you have never experienced before.\nHuge artistic sculptures, noise, people partying on the street, art, satire… there is so much stuff to experience.\nThe best advice is to book your trip to Alicante from the 20th to the 24th of June. But be sure you can party on the 24th as the La bañá happens on that night.\nLast night, when the main festivity ends, the bonfires are burned. A mix of crackers, gasoline and inflammable products designed for bonfires help set the sculpture on fire. Firefighters are in charge of keeping the bonfire burned safely.\nThe bonfires are burnt in the middle of the city, many times quite close to residential buildings. Safe perimeters and the firefighters’ presence ready to take action are foremost for security. La bañá or the bath in English is the act of the firefighters throwing anti-fire water at the spectators.\nChildren, teenagers, and young and senior people get soaked every year during the bañá . Remember that June is already summer and hot at night in Alicante, it is a night to enjoy the tradition.\nHere is a full article about the Hogueras de San Juan Festival if you want to know more.\nWho are the Hogueras de San Juan Museum for?\nAnyone, including children, who want to enjoy fun, satiric and deeply popular rooted sculptures.\nHow much is the entrance ticket to the Hogueras de San Juan Museum?\nThe entrance is free for anyone.\nIs the Hogueras de San Juan museum open?\nYes.\nHogueras de San Juan museum opens:\nSeptember-June\nTuesday-Friday from 10 am to 2 pm and 3 pm to 6 pm\nSaturday from 10 am to 14 pm\nMonday, Sunday and bank holidays are closed\nJuly-August\nTuesday-Friday from 10 am to 2 pm and 6 pm to 9 pm\nSaturday from 10 am to 2 pm\nMonday and Sunday are closed\nAre there guided tours to the Hogueras de San Juan Museum?\nNo, but there are explanations and information brochures at the museum."

    "content_text": "The mushroom have not always been growing at Calle San Francisco . The history of the Mushroom Street (or Calle de Las Setas in Spanish) in Alicante started from a fairy tale story where Alicante was pretty and nice to its people and visitors.\nMushroom Street in Alicante\nThe Mushroom Street in Alicante is situated in Calle San Francisco, Alicante . It is a walkable street with the floor painted green and yellow and two species of mushrooms growing in different personalities since 2013.

For example, in 2001, 20 shops were closed by the city hall due to irregularities ( source in Spanish ).\nBefore and After of the Mushroom Street (photos from Google Maps)\nNowadays, there are dozens of prosperous businesses such as restaurants and shops. The improvement of the economy in the area was the second objective of 2013 City Hall.\nThe mushroom designs were done by Sergio Martinez , an artist who also creates Hogueras for the Bonfires Festival in Alicante .\nIn 2013, taxpayers were looking very closely at every Euro of public spending due to recent corruption cases among the political class and the bad economic situation. The cost of Mushroom Street was €66000 and created a huge polemic discussing if the spending was sensible in the middle of the crisis with high numbers of unemployment.\nWhat to do in the Mushroom Street Alicante?\nOn Mushroom Street there are a variety of hotels, restaurants, children’s playgrounds, shops… and mushroom in different shapes and personalities.\nChildren’s Playground at Mushroom Street\nThere are two different mushroom species. One is tall and slim, with different facial expressions. The others are short and fat, with the shape of a little house where you can enter and look through the windows.\nA House Mushroom Species\nThe most important thing to do in Mushroom Street is to enjoy the mushrooms, pay attention to their different expressions and bugs, and enter the little Mushroom houses to take a photo smiling from one of the windows.\nHappy Mushroom in Alicante\nBut there are also many businesses and bars. Some examples of business in Calle San Francisco or Mushroom Street are:\nEstanco 9 Alicante “LAS SETAS” – Tobacco shop\nPICTUREO Fotografía – Photography\nCaramba ropa y complementos – Clothing Shop\nRestaurante Griego Kalamitsi – Greek Restaurant\nTrendsplant Store San Francisco – Clothing Shop\nCarmen Heredia – Clothing Shop\nMyFlats City Center – Luxury City Center – Hotel\nQuickgold Alicante (San Francisco) – Compro Oro | Casa de Cambio – Gold Dealer\nLa papeleria – Office Appliances Shop\nVino Y Mas – Tapas Bar\nMalevo Brutal Food \u0026 Music – Fast Food Restaurant\nFastighetsbyrån Alicante – Real Estate\nAlicante Local Police – Police Office\nCarnicería Bouziani – Butcher\nLos Mejillones de Correos Bar de tapas Bar con encanto en Alicante – Tapas Bar\nFilatèlia Y Numismàtica Gabriel Miró – Stapm Shop\nMarié Shoes – Shoe Shop\nDa Ciro Ristorante – Pizzeria – Pizza Restaurant\nAmstel Montaditos \u0026 Copas – Tapas Bar\nSala Almonte – Tabern Bar\nLaneu Helados Frescos – Ice Cream Shop\nTandoori House – Indian Restaurant Alicante – Indian Food Restaurant\nTacos No Mames Wey – Mexican Restaurant\nBotigues al Career Shops Celebration\nEvery November for the last 15 years, many businesses on Mushroom Street have organised an open doors day ( source in Spanish ).\nSeveral activities are happening during Botigues al Carrer Open Doors Day:\nspecial product offers\nraffles\nmusic concerts\nchildren’s workshops\nactivities\npromotions\nand more\nIf you are lucky to be in Alicante by the open-doors day you can enjoy discounts and a festive environment. It is also a good activity to do with children.\nIn 2023, the open doors day was on Saturday the 14th of October. Around 30 stores participated including clothing, clothing accessories, shoes, personal care and wine stores.\nThe event ran from 10:30 in the morning until 20:30 in the afternoon with a music concert at 13:00 and a kids’ clown show at 17:00. During the rest of the day there were also workshops for children, music and a photocall apart from the shops’ promotions.\nThere was also an art exposition at Gabriel Miro Square , at the beginning of Calle de Las Setas ."

    "content_text": "Alicante is an ancient Spanish city in the southeast that has grown by the Mediterranean Sea. It has a beautiful old town, vivid culture and nightlife, good food and beautiful beaches . It is also inexpensive (for now) so it is a good place for expats, foreigners and tourists.\nViews to Santa Barbara Castle and Postiguet from Gran Sol Rooftop restaurant\nContents\nToggle\n11 Pros and Reasons Alicante is Good For Living\n1. Alicante Has A Growing International Community\nDon’t be fooled by Alicante’s population size -of 348.731 in 2021- Alicante’s vibe is of a bigger city as it has the 5th busiest airport in Spain (in Spanish) . As Spain is one of the countries receiving the most tourists in the world this means Alicante received 15 million people through its airport in 2019.\nA good 17,2% of the population in Alicante is international. There is more detailed information in the official documents from Alicante’s city hall (in Spanish) .\nHow does this translate into the day-to-day life in the city? Well, many people, especially in the areas with the most expats such as the centre, speak English . Many events in Meetup or Facebook are organised in English and you can have a min-world happening in English if you want. Just as in any other big city in Spain such as Barcelona.\nBut what happens if you want to integrate and speak Spanish? No problem, as soon as you go out from the city centre everything is way more Spanish and the local language gets very handy soon. Also, most of the events are organised by Spaniards or people who have lived in Spain for a long time. A mix of local people and international people assist. There should not be issues if you want to learn the language and integrate more into the Alicantinian society.\n2. There are Areas Where Most of The Expats Live\nIn Alicante, there are areas of the city where most of the expats tend to live. These areas are Alicante Centre (Mercado, El Barrio, Rambla, Luceros…) and Playa de San Juan .\nMost of the fun in Alicante -with most restaurants and nightlife- concentrates in Alicante centre and San Juan Beach so it is the area where most expats tend to live.\n3. Alicante Has Services Adapted to Digital Nomads\nIf you are working remotely, have a start-up or have a digital nomad lifestyle Alicante offers also services for you.\nThere are many places to work in Alicante. Some are free cafes, others are paid co-working spaces. There is also a co-living mid-term apartment building.\nThe city hall is also investing in a new office area in the marina that will be available in the next few months.\nIn Spain, the internet is quite fast. Fibre optic connections -available in most properties- average speeds from 61.68 Mbps to 400.59 Mbps (as per fairinternetreport.com ). Mobile internet is available with 4G and 5G speeds.\n4. It is A Safe City\nAlicante is a safe city. There are 29 offences for every 1000 inhabitants. In comparison, Barcelona has 47.8 offences for every 1000 inhabitants and Madrid has 37. Malaga is just a bit safer with 25.8 per 1000 people. The data is from 2022 and was gathered from this press article (in Spanish) .\nAlicante Port from Santa Barbara Castle at Twilight\n5. The Biggest British Community is Outside the City of Alicante\nAlicante is a typical destination for British people but they usually go to different places in Alicante province and Costa Blanca such as Benidorm or Torrevieja.\nSo if you are worried about the stereotype of British going to Alicante here is some data for you.\nThe British population in the city of Alicante is 0.4% of the total population, 1469 persons. So the city of Alicante is not full of British people (remember Alicante has 348731 inhabitants) for the good and for the bad. The biggest colonies of the British are in nearby areas of the province of Alicante/Costa Blanca.\nAlgerians, Colombians and Italians make up the top 3 of non-Spanish people living in the town and registered in Alicante’s city hall. Ukrainians and Chinese are in positions 10th and 11th. The British are in the position 14th with 1469 people. All this data is from 2021 and was released by Alicante’s city hall here (in Spanish) .\nTop 13 Nationalities in Alicante in 2021\n6. Excellent National and International Connections\nAlicante has:\nBig International Airport\nA train station with Hight Speed trains to Madrid and the north of Spain\nA Coach/Bus station\nMotorways connections\nTRAM Train to Benidorm and other nearby cities\nMadrid is about 2:30 hours away by train; as far as London by plane. For example, Norway, Poland, Barcelona or Italy are not much further.\n7. Alicante and the Province are Rich in Activities and Things to Do\nAs the 4th most populated province in Spain , there are many things to discover and do in the city and nearby the city of Alicante.\nJust a few things to do in Alicante:\nMarq Museum and others\nSanta Barbara Castle\nCalle de Las Setas\nEl Palmeral Park\nCabo de Las Huertas hikes and coves\nSan Juan Beach and other city beaches\nTabarca Island\nTry all the tapas and foods from the different restaurants\nGo party and meet new people\nDiscover what Tardeo is\nAnd other few things to do nearby Alicante\nVisit Villajoyosa, Benidorm , Calpe, Guadalest… You can travel by TRAM\nPractice Aquatic Sports or learn to sail. For example in Santa Pola\nHike in the many mountains such as El Puig Campana , Cabeza de Oro , Penon de Ifach or Maigmo\nVisit the Tea House in Crevillente\nVisit Elche’s Palm Trees Park\nAs you can see, it is not easy to get bored in Alicante.\n8. Alicante is a Nice and Easy Place to Live Providing High QOL\nArguably, Alicante offers high Quality of Live (QOL) , a concept the Spaniards love talking about.\nThe city of Alicante is comfortable. If you live in the centre you will have access to Mercado Central -or central market in English- with quality cheap food, beaches at a walkable distance and good restaurants and nightclubs.\nThe public transport is good with the TRAM train for going to nearby cities and the local bus system working fine for moving around the city. It is also extremely cheap.\nThe scenery is beautiful and there is almost always something going on if you like to join Meetups and different events or local festivities. Also, the weather is surprisingly good.\n9. Alicante Weather is Surprisingly Good\nYes, even winter weather is good in Alicante. One of the main advantages is that the beach can be used from mid-May to mid-October without getting frozen.\nIn summer can get hot but no more than in places such as Madrid, Seville or other coastal cities.\nIt almost never rains except for September to October when it might rain a bit more on average and blue skies are the norm.\n10. People are Friendly\nIn general, people in Alicante are friendly. In the ’60s, when the dictator Franco decided to open Spain to international tourism, one of the areas that benefited was the Costa Blanca/Alicante province.\nThis developed a good sense of humility and prosperity that was attached to international tourism. It was seen as a tool to develop and make profits.\nTherefore, the already inclusive, open and warm Spanish personality assimilated international tourism as an opportunity to worry about and take care of. This idea has been kept in time and Alicantinians have the same attitude towards foreigners nowadays.\nObviously, we are talking about stereotypes but this should guide the general trend in the experience in Alicante.\n11. Alicante is Inexpensive… For Now\nFor example, living in Alicante costs 22.7% less than living in Madrid as per the data from elDiario.es (in Spanish) .\n4 Cons and Reasons Why Alicante is Not Good for Living\n1. Hosing Isolation Might Shock You If You Are From the Cold\nThis is a typical Mediterranean issue; not only affecting Alicante.\nAs Alicante is hot, even in winter , architecture naturally adapts to this fact. Isolation in Alicantinan houses is bad.\nMany northern Europeans have complained about how they are cold in Alicante at home at 15°C sunny outdoors when their countries have 23°C indoors even though it is -10°C outside.\nAnd this is an important point if you are looking for a house in Alicante. Be sure to ask the right questions about isolation and cold/heat systems as not refurbishment houses might not have any A/C or radiators.\nAlso, bear in mind that heating is usually easier than cooling. So, for example, if a house doesn’t have a boiler for the radiators a heater from Carrefour would do the thing. But the same is not true for the heat. Fans can help but when it is really hot only A/C can really cold down the flat and A/C systems need proper installation.\nAnd obviously, don’t worry that much about hot water. That’s a must even in old and not refurbished flats.\n2. When it Rains, It Really Rains\nAt the end of the summer, the Mediterranean sea warms up a lot, getting even close to 30°C.\nThis overheated sea can sometimes fuel heavy rains in Alicante and many other Mediterranean cities. It should not worry you much and if any meteo alert is happening at the time you are in Alicante you will know through the press or the people you meet.\nIt is important to follow the official directions you might see yourself in any heavy rain situation. More about heavy rains topic is here.\n3. The Job Market is Not Dynamic\nIf you are looking for a job in Alicante -or in Spain in general- you are soon to realise that the market is not as good as in many other countries.\nAlicante has an unemployment rate of 18.95% in 2022 as per data from expansion.com . But, for example, Benidorm’s data is better with 13.13% of unemployment. For Spain, in general, the figure is 12.4%.\n4. Valenciano\nThis is only important if you are thinking of moving in with children. If not, you can just ignore the next couple of paragraphs.\nAlicante is part of the Valencian Comunity . In this autonomous community, it is set by law that there is an extra official language apart from Spanish: Valenciano. The language itself is the same as Catalan just a variant of it.\nValenciano is not spoken much in Alicante and everyone is able to speak Spanish. The language might be used a bit more in other areas and towns of Alicante province, such as Alcoy, and some other areas of the Autonomous Community.\nIf you have children of studying age you should know that it is mandatory to learn Valenciano at school. You might be able to trespass on this in international private schools but inform them about this first. And it comes with a fee."

    "content_text": "Alicante is a ~350k people city in Easter Spain, touching the Mediterranean sea . It is a pretty Spanish working city with tourism.\nSanta Barbara Castle Speaking Languages. This Artwork used a pngtree.com image\nIn Alicante, -as per the latest data from EF – the level of English is moderate : 546/1000 points. Tourists will find it easy to effectively communicate in English at hotels, restaurants and touristy attractions. Making new English-speaking friends is easy too thanks to Alicante’s vibrant international community. For longer stays, the city will naturally invite you into learning Spanish to fully integrate with its welcoming people.\nIn Alicante, there are two official languages -Spanish and Valencian- and English is studied at school. But more languages live in the city.\nContents\nToggle\nHow Much English is Spoken in Alicante\nAt Spanish schools, it is mandatory to study a foreign language. It is usually English but some schools would allow you to choose another language such as French.\nChildren usually start at a young age to learn English; when they are 6 but this not always translates into a good English level.\nOver the last few years, the teaching of the foreign language has improved. Some schools in Spain have a degree of bilingualism teaching children a few of the subjects in English.\nEnglish level is usually separated into 4 separate competencies:\nListening\nSpeaking\nReading\nWriting\nExams, usually, have different ways to evaluate these different competencies.\nIn the last few years, many schools have incorporated conversation assistants giving the opportunity to, usually, young Americans, British or Australians to come to Spain with a scholarship to teach and speak English with the students at a Spanish school.\nThis way, it would be easier for students to acquire better speaking and listening skills. But the reality is that many people would acquire some degree of proficiency in Reading and Writing but the Speaking and Listening level ends up not being too high.\nAlso, not every school in Spain have a speaking assistant and the proficiency level acquired by the students will depend on the degree of bilingualism in the School, the teachers and the students themselves . Despite the efforts in improving English teaching, the average student would probably end up having less than a B1 level of English (in Spanish) when leaving school.\nAlicante is not different to the rest of Spain in this matter -the English level, on average, is not high-, but has an advantage as an international city.\nEnglish Level for Tourists\nIn Alicante, people understand the importance of English when attending international tourism and virtually all touristy spots in the city speak English: tourist offices, bars and restaurants, monuments and landmarks (such as Alicante’s castle ), hotel staff, beaches lifeguards, airport staff, rented car offices and many other people will make a successful effort in communicating in English.\nIf you are visiting Alicante don’t worry about the English level as you will be able to communicate anything you need with the people you will be in touch with in good English.\nEnglish Level if you Live in Alicante\nWhen spending more time in Alicante the English level can become a greater challenge.\nIn Spain and Alicante, there are some services focused on English speakers, such as Lobster -a mobile phone network focused on English speakers in Spain- or online banks with apps and customer support fully in English. But other bills such as electricity or water will be in Spanish.\nAlicante also has a big international community which makes it easier to make new English-speaking friends from all over Europe and the world.\nBut in your day to day, you will, inevitably, encounter the language barrier. Creating connections with local people will be harder as many won’t speak enough English. Going to the grocery store (such as Mercadona) might be an experience as products’ names and descriptions will be only in Spanish and the staff probably won’t speak much English.\nThe good news is that if you came to Spain to improve your Spanish, then, the city will naturally invite you into improving your Spanish, at the very least, to a basic level, so you can move around in your day-to-day at ease.\nIf you want to learn Spanish at a higher level many language Schools are teaching Spanish to foreigners plus Alicante has a vibrant and lively vibe where you can find language exchanges in meetup.com and Facebook.com groups to practice your language skills while meeting new friends.\nOfficial Languages in Alicante\nSpain is divided into Autonomous Communities and provinces.\nAn Autonomous Community is a larger region such as Valencian Community ( where Alicante is situated ) or Andalucia (where Malaga is situated).\nA province is a smaller division such as Alicante province -where Alicante city and Benidorm are located- or Malaga province -where Malaga city or Marbella are located-.\nSome of the Autonomous Communities have a second official language apart from Spanish. The Valencian Community, where Alicante is located, have a second language called Valenciano . It is the same language as Catalan spoken in Catalonia (where Barcelona is located) but with a different slang and accent.\nThe reality is that Valenciano is not spoken in a big chunk of Alicante’s province and the adoption in Alicante city is low compared to other cities in the Autonomous Community. Only 15% of people use Valenciano daily in the city of Alicante (in Spanish). So it won’t be an issue if you want to learn and practice your Spanish.\nIf you are a tourist or an adult resident this won’t influence your stay at all. Most people speak just Spanish in their day-to-day life and Valenciano is quite a minority language for most people. If you live in the city with school-age children then you should know it is mandatory by law to study some subjects in Valenciano .\nOther Languages in Alicante City\nIn Alicante, there are people from many different nationalities. Some of the languages that you might listen to on the street when you go for a walk are Arabic, French, Italian, Ukrainian, Russian, Chinese and many others.\nHere is a list of the top nationalities by the population residing in Alicante city as per 2022 data ( source Diputacion de Alicante ) and the language spoken in their coutnries of origin:\nNacionality Total Oficial Lanuage(s) Spoken in Origin Country Total Population 338577 – Spanish 🇪🇸 287886 Spanish Foreigners 50691 – European 18010 – America (continent) 15925 – Africans 13081 – EU 🇪🇺 10271 – Europe Non EU 7739 – Argelia 🇩🇿 7389 Arabic, French Colombia 🇨🇴 5600 Spanish Marruecos 🇲🇦 3882 Arabic, Berber Asia 3603 – Italia 🇮🇹 3408 Italian Rusia 🇷🇺 2887 Russian Venezuela 🇻🇪 2425 Spanish Ukraine 🇺🇦 2183 Ukranian Argentina 🇦🇷 1891 Spanish China 🇨🇳 1810 Chinese Romania 🇷🇴 1737 Romanian Francia 🇫🇷 1136 French United Kingdom 🇬🇧 1049 English Ecuador 🇪🇨 824 Spanish Cuba 🇨🇺 738 Spanish Brazil 🇧🇷 706 Portuguese Paraguay 🇵🇾 671 Spanish Bulgaria 🇧🇬 627 Bulgarian List of Foreign population in Alicante city and the Language Spoken in their origin country.

    "content_text": "Alicante and Malaga are two beautiful cities and provinces. It is not easy to choose between two top-tier beach and mountain destinations in Spain.\nAlicante and Malaga are comparable beach cities with different souls. Malaga has grown modern, leaving away some of the cute prettiness traditional Spanish cities have. Alicante, instead, has managed to keep its heritage in better shape. Alicante overperforms on beaches and Malaga in museums.\nAlicante Versus Malaga\nTo be honest, probably your best option is not to choose between the cities and visit Alicante and Malaga. But time is limited and each city has its nuances, so what should you prioritize?\nContents\nToggle\nWhat Makes Alicante and Malaga Similar\nThe two cities are similar and their differences are in their nuances. If you have the opportunity to visit any of them do not hesitate about your trip. Only if you can choose between the two pay attention to these nuances.\nAlicante and Malaga have both thousands of years of history (literally) on their backs. They are far enough from each other to have many nuances on different civilizations inhabiting their respective areas.\nThe most recent heritage Malaga and Alicante have is Roman and medieval but both cities hold older remains. On the top of both cities, we can find a castle: Castillo de Santa Barbara in Alicante and Castillo de Gibralfaro in Malaga , both built by the Muslims.\nThe two cities have managed to adapt to modern times and become great touristic destinations.\nMalaga and Alicante, are great places to spend your holidays or even think about relocating. Both cities have:\neasy access to beaches,\na castle on the top of a hill (Alicante, in fact, has two fortifications),\namazing natural places and cities nearby for day trips,\ngood restaurants,\nfun nightlife,\nimportant airports,\nbus and train connections,\nsunny and warm weather in summer and winter\nThe cities have all you would expect of a beach destination.\nWhat Makes Alicante and Malaga Different\nThe City Sizes\nMalaga is bigger than Alicante. There were 571 026 people living in Malaga in 2018 vs 337 482 people living in Alicante in 2020 . But Alicante’s vibe is of a bigger city. The province of Alicante (which Alicante city is the capital) has the 5th highest population in Spain. On the other hand, Malaga province has a similar population but is in the 6th position.\nThe city of Alicante is more compact than the city of Malaga and that is felt when walking around. Alicante has the most iconic areas at a short walk reach. It has managed to grow its character into nearby and beautiful areas. Two examples are the promenade “ La Explanada” or the harbour. All at a very short distance from each other. Instead, Malaga has a beautiful old town but it is sided by less special modern city block buildings.\nThe Weather\nIn general, Malaga weather is more extreme while the weather in Alicante is milder. In summer both cities are super hot but Malaga gets the most extreme temperatures and averages more heat. During winter the opposite is true and Alicante averages a bit colder days. The difference between both cities’ temperatures in summer is bigger than the difference in winter.\nThe sea is warmer in Alicante during the summer and a bit colder in winter. Again, the sea in Alicante is more appreciably warmer in the summer than colder in the winter. Always when compared to Malaga’s sea.\nMalaga (107) averages a bit more sunshine per year than Alicante (97 days).\nIn general, the difference between the weather in Alicante and Malaga is small. Alicante is milder with less extreme temperatures, especially heat than Malaga.\nThe Beaches\nBoth cities have good city beaches. Usually, the beaches in Alicante are better rated. The sand in Malaga is more compact while the sand in Alicante tends to be more golden and not compacted.\nMisericordia Beach in Malaga\nThe integration of the city beach into the city itself is usually better in Alicante. The main city beach, El Postiguet, is right in the city centre. There is even an easy public transport bus straight from the airport to the beach . The TRAM trains to nearby beaches such as San Juan Beach are well connected to the city centre.\nEl Postiguet Beach Alicante\nAlso, the sea temperature is usually higher in Alicante than in Malaga during the summer.\nThe Food and Restaurants\nMalaga and Alicante are situated in different Spanish regions. Alicante is situated in the southeast of Spain while Malaga is situated in the south. Therefore, the traditional dishes are different from one region and the other.\nDespite this difference, it is easy to find traditional Spanish dishes mixed in each region. So you can find Gazpacho Andaluz in Alicante and Paella in Malaga. But here is a tip: Food exported from one region to the other will miss local nuances that make the food even more special.\nFor example, the famous regional dish in Alicante is Paella but the people of Alicante don’t prepare paella , they cook Arroz . An arguably better version of paella .\nThe same is true in Malaga. Local people from Malaga don’t prepare Gazpacho Andaluz, they prepare Porra Antequerana . It is, again, similar to the main commercial gazpacho but an arguably better version.\nEven dishes that are widely famous in Spain, such as Tortilla de Patatas , have differences in their preparation depending on the region.\nIn both areas, the people would eat tapas-style food.\nTraditional food in Malaga and Alicante\nIn Malaga, we have the following regional traditional dishes. Note this is just a short list:\nFritura Malaguena – fried fish from the Mediterranean\nPorra de Antequera – Cold soup\nEspeto de Sardinas – Grilled Sardina fish\nEnsalada Malagueña – Salad filled with potatoes, oranges, cod…\nAnd in Alicante, there are other traditional dishes. Again, this is not a complete list:\nArroz – paella style dish but arguably better. Can be arroz a banda, arroz con costra, caldero (Tabarca) , etc\nFideua – similar to Arroz/paella but with noodles instead of rice\nMojama de atun – or tuna mojama. Dry slices of tuna loin\nAllioli – a sauce based on garlic\nResturants In Alicante and Malaga\nThe two cities have excellent gastronomic offers. Restaurants and tapas bars are the common eat-out options. Probably this is a point that should not help you to decide between your holiday destination.\nBut let’s going to give some data.\nAs per numbeo.com , Alicante’s restaurants and bars are a bit more expensive than in Malaga: 1.48% more expensive. This might be compensated by the general prices in Alicante. It is a cheaper city in general.\nGroceries, for example, are 1.59% cheaper in Alicante and rents are an astonishing 22.18% lower in Alicante than in Malaga.\nA study done in 2017 shows the restaurants and bars per capita in Spanish cities (in Spanish). It shows that Alicante has 2.83 restaurants per 1000 inhabitants while Malaga has 1.84. None of the cities is in the top 10 restaurants per capita in Spain. But quality is more important than quantity.\nThe Nightlife\nThis is a topic where, again, both cities are in a similar position. Both cities have an international vibe with bars and pubs for all tastes, having a lot of reggaeton and Latin music but also international.\nTransport and Connections to Alicante and Malaga\nBoth Alicante and Malaga have big international Airports but Malaga Airport has more connections.\nWhile Alicante has 132 connections Malaga has 154 connections . The first city flights to most of the European countries plus Morroco and Egypt. On the other hand, people in Malaga can fly to most European countries plus the East Coast in the United States, Morroco, Egypt Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\nMalaga’s Airport is in the 4th position as per passenger traffic per year in Spain and Alicante’s airport is in the 5th ( source in Spanish ). If you plan to travel mostly in Europe the difference between both airports is not huge.\nDay Trips From Malaga and Alicante\nThe surrounding areas of both cities are amazing. Alicante’s province and Malaga’s province are filled with picturesque coasts, mountains and beautiful towns.\nFor example, near Alicante, you can visit Benidorm or Valencia for a day. Malaga, Marbella and Granada are not too far away. Both regions have good train and bus connections.\nIf you like sea sports or mountain adventure, again, both regions have a lot to offer. Hikes, adventure activities, balloon rides, paragliding… all that is available in both regions.\nMalaga will outperform on winter sports such as skiing as it is very close to Granada and the Sierra Nevada. It is extremely rare, and near to impossible, for any of the cities to have any snow at all in winter. Both are dry and warm areas and locals will only have seen snow if they had purposely travelled to the nearby mountains or other snowy places.\nIn Alicante’s mountains, it usually snows every year and can settle for a few days. On the other hand, Malaga is very close to Sierra Nevada where there are proper skiing facilities ready for skiers.\nAlicante and Malaga Festivals\nAlicante and Malaga have both a week-long festival.\nAlicante celebrates Hogueras de San Juan 19th-24th of June and Malaga celebrates La Feria de Malaga on the 3rd week of August.\nAlicantinos celebrate the beginning of the summer on the millenary tradition of Saint John bonfires while Malagueños celebrate the Reconquista or reconquering of Malaga from the Moors by the Spanish Catholic Monarchs.\nFeria de Malaga Wheel\nAlicante’s festival has huge street bonfires featuring images of satirical humour while Malaga’s festival has a huge fair with rides and attractions.\nHoguera in Alicante\nIn both festivals, there is a party on the street -Casetas in Malaga and Barracas/Racos in Alicante- plus traditional dresses (Alicantino clothing in Alicante and Sevillano dresses in Malaga).\nThe tradition in both cities is to invite and integrate visitors to the festivity. Alicante has open Racos where anyone can enter to dance and drink while Malaga has public-open Casetas where anyone can join the dance and party.\nAlicante Compared to Other Cities\nIf you want to more about how Alicante compares with other cities check these articles:\nHow does compare Alicante VS Valencia .\nMoving to Alicante VS London\nComparison between Alicante VS Ibiza\nIs Malaga better than Alicante?\nBoth destinations are similar. Alicante might have a bit more charm as a city, slightly better sandy beaches with warmer seawater, and be a bit less suffocating in summer (but warmer in winter). On the other hand, Malaga might have a bit more galleries and museums to visit."

    "content_text": "Alicante and Valencia are two extremely different cities in the same Spanish autonomous community or region.\nAlicante or Valencia?\nAlicante is a medium size pretty beach city while Valencia is the 3rd Spanish city by population within commuting distance of the sea. Alicante is compact -not small- while Valencia is spread out. Alicante province, Costa Blanca, is one of the most impressive coastlines in Spain. Both are rich in heritage.\nBoth cities are good if you want a cultural and heritage visiting break. Alicante overperforms on beaches, gastronomy and natural beauty while Valencia offers more variety of cultural activities such as monuments and museums.\nContents\nToggle\nVisiting Alicante or Valencia\nBoth cities are beautiful and worth visiting. Alicante is more picturesque and features amazing urban beaches while Valencia has a bigger traditional centre but with no-so-nice beaches that are far from the centre.\nWhile Alicante is very compact to visit (except for some museums and Tabarca Island ) Valencia is more spread out.\nValencia features better central parks, such as Jardin del Turia , a dried-out river bed splitting the city in two featuring a nice green park. Alicante, instead, features nice and beautiful beaches instead in the city centre -such as El Postiguet – and the nice parks such as El Palmeral – that are on the outskirts of the city.\nCulture and Heritage\nAlicante has several museums that are worth visiting, such as Marq Museum , to discover more about the archaeology of the city and its origins while Valencia has an amazing “ Ciudad de las Artes y las Ciencias ” with a science museum and an oceanographic that are totally worth visiting apart from important national museums such as Museo Nacional de Cerámica (in Spanish).\nConnections\nAlicante is better connected than Valencia internationally through Alicante’s Airport ( 132 destinations in Alicante VS 102 destinations in Valencia and almost x2 passengers traffic in Alicante Airport -in Spanish- ). Valencia’s airport is small but still international with connections to most European countries.\nRegarding train connections, there are high-speed trains to Madrid and north Spain from Alicante and Valencia. Also slower trains to Barcelona. Valencia has a shorter train commute to Barcelona and a slightly faster high-speed train to Madrid.\nHotels and Hostels\nValencia city gets more hotels and hostel beds than Alicante city but thanks to nearby towns, in Alicante province there are way more hotel beds than in Valencia province. Prices are similar but there is more hotel offer in Valencia City so might be a bit easier to find good prices in the high season but the difference should be minimal.\nFood\nGastronomically, Valencia City is a bit better than Alicante City. In Valencia city, there are 6 restaurants awarded by Estrella Michelin while Alicante has 2 ( source in Spanish ). But again, when we observe the province, Alicante wins with 11 awarded restaurants VS 8 in Valencia.\nThis difference in Estrella Michelin awards might not be a projection on where to actually eat better as both cities have extraordinary Tapas and Spanish food offered at their restaurants as well as Vegetarian, Vegan and international cuisine. It is very easy to eat well in any of both cities with any modality of diet you prefer.\nValencia’s famous dish is Paella but you can taste it in Alicante too. Or even better, you can be seduced by Alicante’s Arroces , similar to Paella but featuring more seafood and fish instead of rabbit meat.\nWeather\nIn both cities the weather is very similar: sunny, warm -even in winter- and dry. If you want to know more read an expanded analysis of the weather of both cities below.\nIn short, Alicante is a good balance of culture, beach and nature tourism plus if you add the province of Alicante there is a lot to see and do. On the other hand, Valencia is a perfect cultural destination but it is less picturesque and underperforms on beaches. The good thing is both cities are 200km (125 mi) away with good roads and reliable train connections so you might be able to actually visit both.\nThe Nightlife\nBoth cities are big enough to have differentiated nightlife areas.\nValencia has Ruzafa, Marina/Beach area, Juan Llorens, Universidad, Canovas…\nAlicante has El Barrio, Castanos, El Puerto, San Juan Beach …\nBoth cities are big enough to accommodate a variety of age ranges and music styles, while Alicante has a bit less offer of techno.\nLiving in Alicante or Valencia\nAlicante and Valencia have very different vibes for living. While Alicante City and Alicante Province are extremely international Valencia feels more homogeneous-Spanish.\nThe Cities Vibe\nIf you know a bit about the vibe of Barcelona and Madrid we can use them as references. While Barcelona is super international and well connected to Europe and the world, Madrid is way more Spanish, a place where you can listen to many different Spanish accents from Spain and Latin America but not other languages.\nWhile you can spend days listening to just Spanish in Madrid, Barcelona is quite the opposite and you will hear a variety of languages as soon as you put your feet out on the street.\nWell, Alicante is like Barcelona in that matter but without the delinquency issues and not so extremely international and touristy. Instead, Valencia is more like Madrid where Spanish (or maybe some Valenciano Language ) would be listened to for days. It is also not so well mixed as Madrid on different Spanish accents.\nRemember a lot of tourism in Alicante doesn’t stay in the city but goes to Benidorm , Calpe, Torrevieja and other places in the province. So both cities -Alicante and Valencia- are very Spanish in the sense that many Spaniards not working in tourism and just carry on with their own lives and jobs.\nAlicante and Valencia Populations\nValencia is the 3rd city in Sapin by population ( 792,492 inhabitants ) while Alicante is the 10th ( 348,901 inhabitants ). At first glance, comparing both places might look unfair. The population has some weight on why the vibe is so different in both cities but not that much. The reality is that Alicante and Valencia are not so far away in population, let me explain.\nAs this list (in Spanish) shows, Valencia’s province is 3rd among the provinces with the most population in Spain (2,600,793 inhabitants), holding 5.46% of the country’s population. This makes sense as Valencia is the 3rd most populated city in Spain.\nBut when you look at Alicante’s province it is in the 5th position of the most populated province in Spain (!) (1,923,000 inhabitants) holding 4.04% of the population in the country (vs 5.46% of Valencia). That is even more population than in Malaga province.\nValencia province holds only 35% more of the population than Alicante province while the city’s population is x5 more than in Alicante. Remind Alicante City is in the 10th position of the most populated cities in Spain.\nThis is due to all the important cities in Alicante province such as Alicante itself, Elche, Torrevieja or Orihuela. Also, there are a few really closer cities you can reach in a short time by busses or TRAM such as San Vicente, Campello or San Juan ( source in Spanish ) that are -virtually- part of the same urban area. Alicante province, holding a smaller surface, is also more densely populated than Valencia province.\nThis demographic factor shows Alicante -even if the city is not huge (but remember it is also not small)- has a vibe usually typical of a larger city. If you add commuting opportunities such as the night TRAM train during summer -to, for example, Benidorm -, busses , night busses , private cars or taxis you will find living in Alicante -supposedly “small”- won’t mean missing out on the opportunities of bigger cities.\nAlicante becomes the mix of both worlds: cousy and nice in day-to-day life plus exploratory and different on the weekends. Here, there is a comparison of living in Alicante VS Living in London , which can sound like an exotic comparison but might help understand how is life comparing truly big cities versus Alicante.\nValencia, instead, overperforms Alicante on day-to-day activities. It is easier to find options on evening gigs, art expositions or cultural activities even though Alicante is catching up. Being a bigger city plays in Valencia’s favour on that matter.\nWork\nIf you are a foreigner thinking of moving to Alicante or Valencia, my first recommendation is always to try moving with a job from your home country and work remotely. There are several legal forms you can use for that. You could start investigating Autonomo if you are an EU citizen or a Digital Nomad Visa if you are from outside the EU. Or a Retirement Visa if you don’t have to work anymore and have a pension.\nSpain is still a cheap country compared with most other countries in Europe and most of the Western world so your origin country’s salary would probably last longer in Alicante if you are able to keep it. Also, Valencia is a bit more expensive than Alicante ( source in Spanish ) but both are still cheaper than Madrid, Barcelona or Palma.\nInstead, if you want to find a job in Valencia or Alicante the reality is Valencia has more diverse opportunities than Alicante. Indeed, Valencia makes it to the 4th position of cities with more job offers while Alicante is not in the top 10 cities ( source in Spanish ).\nIn Alicante, Distrito Digital is giving more work opportunities in heavily IT-based companies in Alicante. There is an official trend of promoting digital work in Alicante coming from Alicante’s city hall and the autonomous community. So if this is your sector you might have things a bit easier.\nIf you are a lawyer, judge, translator or have other skills useful for EUIPO (European Union Intellectual Property Office) it might be worth checking opportunities there. Also, tourism-related employment, solar energy and foreigner-related employment should be a bit easier in Alicante and its province but for other sectors such as the car industry, the opportunities might just work out easier in Valencia.\nWeather\nAlicante’s and Valencia’s weather is very similar but Alicante’s is slightly more influenced by the sea. Remember Alicante is a beach city while Valencia has the beach a few miles away except for some neighbourhoods.\nThe weather in Alicante is slightly more humid than in Valencia. Also, Alicante averages a bit higher maximum temperatures through the year (just around 1°C) than Valencia as well as slightly lower minimum temperatures than in Valencia (around 1°C difference).\nAlicante also has slightly less rain than Valencia as well as clearer skies.\n(Source for Valencia and source for Alicante . Both in Spanish)\nBut the weather in both cities is very similar and might not need to be a factor to account when choosing the city where you want to live next.\nFor a better understanding of winters in Alicante check this page .\nIs Alicante the Same as Valencia?\nNo, Valencia and Alicante are two very different cities and provinces within Spain.\nSometimes, Spanish people use the word “Valencia” to speak about the region where Valencia and Alicante are situated: Comunidad Valenciana or Valencian Comunity.\nInterchanging the names “Valencia” and “Valencian Comunity” creates a lot of confusion so it is better to get a clarification from your interlocutor when it happens. In short:\nAlicante city and Alicante province are in the Valencian Comunity\nValencia city and Valencia province are in the Valencian Comunity\nPeople, sometimes, use the word Valencia to refer to the Valencian Community creating a lot of confusion\nAlicante Compared to Other Cities\nIf you want to more about how Alicante compares with other cities check these articles:\nMalaga is a similar city to Alicante in south Spain.

    "content_text": "Alicante and Ibiza are both pretty cities and areas in the Mediterranean Sea. A two top-tier destination for beach holidays and living.\nAlicante or Ibiza\nAlicante City is more beautiful and charming than Ibiza City. Beaches, coves and nature are top-tier comparable but Ibiza has more density of natural spaces. Ibiza excels in parties, luxury and nightlife while Alicante is still fun and lively. Culturally, both destinations are appealing.\nBoth cities and areas can be similar when looking for a relaxed holiday but very different if your aim is big DJ names and parties.\nContents\nToggle\nAlicante and Ibiza\nAlicante and Ibiza are separated by 111 nautical miles or 178 km. Both cities are connected by direct regular flights from Alicante Airport to Ibiza Airport. The closest ferry from Alicante to Ibiza departs from Denia and it is operated by Balearia .\nPlane running the regular connection Alicante-Ibiza\nAlicante and Ibiza names can both refer to the actual name of a city and also the name for the area where they are situated in southeast and east Spain.\nAlicante is a city on the Mediterranean coast southeast of mainland Spain. But Alicante is also the province’s name where other towns such as Benidorm , Elche, Torrevieja or Calpe are situated. Also, Costa Blanca is the name of the seaside of the province of Alicante.\nSimilarly, Ibiza is the name of the city of Ibiza but also the name of the island of Ibiza which is part of the Balearic Islands, an autonomous community inside Spain.\nIt is important to understand these key nuances to look fairly at both destination strengths.\nAlicante and Ibiza Populations\nAlicante is the 10th city by population in Spain with 348,901 inhabitants while Ibiza city has just 49,727 inhabitants.\nBoth areas, Ibiza Island and Alicante province, have a lot of population spread out around smaller cities. While Alicante is the 4th province in Spain by population -with around 1,965,252 inhabitants- Ibiza Island has 154,186 inhabitants. All the Balearic islands (including Mallorca and others) have a population of 1,232,270 people.\nTherefore Alicante has a lot more population than Ibiza in both the cities and areas.\nAlicante or Ibiza for Beaches\nIbiza city has less appealing beaches than Alicante city. While Alicante has more than 10 truly amazing urban beaches , including El Postiguet , right in the city centre of the city, Ibiza has a less beautiful beach in the suburbs called Playa Den Bossa Sea .\nWhen comparing the province of Alicante versus Ibiza Island the picture is a bit different but not by much.\nBanderas Azules or Blue Flags\nThere is an internationally recognised award called Blue Flag ( Bandera Azul in Spanish) . The beaches, to get the award, need to comply with several criteria related to:\nEnvironmental education and information\nWater quality\nEnvironmental management\nSafety and services\nWhile Alicante’s province beaches had 69 Blue Flags in 2023 shared around many different cities and towns in Costa Blanca ( source in Spanish ) the Island of Ibiza had only 4 Blue Flags in 2023 ( source in Spanish ).\nThis doesn’t necessarily mean Ibiza’s beaches are bad but many of them don’t comply with all the high standards criteria for the Blue Flags, such as lifeguard services or beach and water parameters monitorization; such as water temperature and quality or Sun radiation, for example.\nPretty Ibiza Cove With no Blue Flag as it doesn’t have lifeguards or water quality monitoring\nIn Alicante Province, you can find truly amazing beaches and coves that can compete directly with the beauty of the beaches and coves in Ibiza. But Ibiza has a slightly bigger concentration of coves and beaches than Alicante, even though many of them don’t have any beach services (such as lifeguard) or miss several of them.\nWhile Ibiza has more natural and non-urban beaches and coves than Alicante there is probably not enough time to visit all of them in a few days holiday. But the same applies to Alicante’s province and all its beaches and coves, many of them natural and non-urban too.\nIn summary, Alicante city has better beaches than Ibiza city and more high-quality beaches in the province are recognised with the high standards of the Blue Flag award. Ibiza Island overperforms in the number of non-urban, more natural and serviceless beaches and coves.\nAlicante or Ibiza for Nightlife\nFor big DJ fans and big disco club addicts, Alicante City has little to do with Ibiza City.\nWhile Ibiza city has very famous discos such as Amnesia , Pachá , Privilege , Lio Ibiza, Usuahia o Hï Ibiza Alicante City has Marmarela , Copity or Puntapiedra .\nLio Ibiza Restaurant\nAlicantinian clubs, despite being very decent, can not compete with the huge Ibiza clubs and the importance of artists going there for their music sessions.\nAgain, when we zoom out to Alicante province the picture is quite different. Alicante’s province has big discos like Metro Dance Club for techno or KM , Penelope , Privilege X or KU in Benidorm.\nSwimming Pool at Marmarela\nFrom the city of Alicante, there are public transport connections to Metro Dance Club catching the train to Orihuela and then a short ride by taxi. Also during summer, there is a night TRAM train connecting the city of Alicante with Benidorm all night ( and early morning trains in winter ) so going to Benidorm for a party is very easy on public transport from Alicante City with the only disadvantage of being a bit time-consuming.\nThere are also important festivals and DJ sessions happening every so often around Alicante’s province, such as the Low Festival or Spring Festival but still Iibiza is the big winner.\nAlicante or Ibiza for Cultural Activites\nIf you like history, museums , archaeology… both cities and areas are excellent destinations.\nNeither Alicante nor Ibiza can be compared with cities such as Madrid, Paris or London where big national museums are home to famous paintings such as the Mona Lisa or Las Meninas .\nBut both areas have been inhabited by millennials and there are many remains to visit in its different coves, archaeological museums – such as MARQ museum – or archaeological sites.\nThe closeness of both destinations gives them a similar -but not equal- rainbow of cultures having been inhabited both areas by the Romans, Muslims and Christians. Also, both cities have been trade and military hubs with rich histories to tell.\nAlicante or Ibiza for Public Transport\nPublic transport is a big win for Alicante versus Ibiza areas.\nTransport in Ibiza VS Alicante Areas\nIn Ibiza, a car is necessary if you want to visit its beautiful countryside and the different beaches around the island. There is a good bus system in Ibiza but it doesn’t connect many of the coast side of the island.\nOn the other hand, the Alicante area has the TRAM train that joins many of Alicante’s city beaches plus all the major cities from Alicante city to the north up to Denia, such as Benidorm, Calpe or Altea.\nThe bus company, Alsa, operates in Alicante too, from Alicante’s coach station , joining by bus many of Alicante’s province cities such as Alcoy or Benidorm but also the south of the province such as Torrevieja or La Zenia.\nThere is also a Cercanias train from Alicante’s train station going to cities such as Elche or Orihuela up to Murcia.\nAs in Ibiza, Alicante has many rental car companies to freely explore more places with cheap cars available.\nTransport Inside Ibiza and Alicante Cities\nIbiza city is not very big. You won’t probably need to use public transport to visit most of its highlights.\nSimilarly, Alicante’s old town and the city centre are also not very big but have more hills than in Ibiza as it is around Santa Barbara Castle . But there is a good bus and Tram service that connects the centre with the beaches , parks and other parts of the city.\nAlicante or Ibiza Airport, Ferries and National and International Connections\nInternational connections are again a win for Alicante versus Ibiza. Not only because of the advantage of being in Mainland Spain but also because Alicante’s airport is bigger and with more connections than Ibiza Airport.\nIbiza Airport\nGet to Ibiza VS Alicante\nWhen planning on how to get into Alicante or Ibiza, the first city has several options:\nAlicante Airport\nRail including high-speed trains\nRoad\nFerry/private boat\nWhile Ibiza has only two options:\nAirport\nFerry/private boat\nWhat makes sense as one of the highlights of Ibiza is the island vibes.\nBut while Alicante’s Airport is the 5th airport with more passenger traffic in Spain Ibiza is the 8th with almost 40% less traffic than Alicante. Ibiza is more difficult to reach by plane. ( source in Spanish )\nBy ferry, the story is similar. Balearia is the leading company connecting the peninsula with Ibiza. Ships from Denia (a town in Alicante province), Gandia (a town in Valencia province), Valencia and Barcelona go to Ibiza from mainland Spain. Ibiza also connects by ferry to other islands in the Balearics: Formentera and Palma de Mallorca .\nAlicante has ferry connections to Alger (Argelia), Oran (Argelia), Ibiza Island, Formentera and Palma de Mallorca .\nAlicante train connections go to Murcia, Madrid, north and north-west Spain and Barcelona with stops in all the cities on the route. Including high-speed trains to Madrid, the north of Spain and Murcia.\nAlicante has several motorways reaching the city from the north (such as Benidorm or Barcelona), south (such as Murcia or Malaga ), the indoors of the province (such as Villena or Alcoy) and the centre of the country (such as Madrid and the north of Spain).\nAlicante VS Ibiza Prices\nIbiza is significantly more expensive than Alicante.\nAs per nomadlist.com the medium price of a hotel room in Alicante is £84/night in Alicante while it is £147/night in Ibiza. In both places, you can find significantly cheaper prices so take these prices just as a reference.\nThe reference cost of a dinner is £9.43 in Alicante while it is £12 in Ibiza.\nBoth cities get significantly lower prices in accommodation during winter and the low season.\nAlicante or Ibiza Daytrips\nBoth places are good for day trips.\nIn Ibiza, apart from exploring beaches and the countryside, there are several ferries per day to Formentera. This island has several amazing beaches to explore, a lighthouse and paradisiacal landscapes.\nFormentera Beach at Dusk\nThe island of Formentera can be visited in a day but you probably need a motorbike or a car to explore properly.\nIn Alicante, there are many day trips to do. The province of Alicante is big and very variated, from mountains to incredible beaches, caves, coves, rivers, hikes and many other activities. Alicante has also an Island to visit: Tabarca .\nTabarca Island Beach\nThe island of Tabarca is small and cute. It has a tiny old town and several restaurants for lunch and a few hotels. You don’t need a car or motorbike to visit it as it is walkable in approx 1h. It has a main sandy beach and a few coves to enjoy. It is also a good place if you like snorkelling.\nAlicante or Ibiza for the Countryside\nThe countryside in Ibiza and Alicante is somehow similar. Both places are mountainous and have a similar vegetation.\nBut Alicante province has more variety of landscapes such as pine and Holm oak forests in the north of the province and desertic landscape in the south.\nAlicante and Ibiza Weather\nIn both places the peak tourist season is summer. Prices are significantly lower during the winter months.\nWhen it comes to the weather both places are warm all year round but. It can be argued that Ibiza has slightly better weather as it doesn’t get as hot or as cold -on average-. Also, the difference between day and night temperatures is smaller in Ibiza.\nAlicante and Ibiza year temperatures. Source weather-atlas.com\nWhen it comes to rain, Ibiza has a few more days of rain per year than Alicante but both can still be considered a very dry areas.\nRainfall in Alicante vs. Ibiza. Source weather-atlas.com\nThe sea temperature is extremely similar in both Alicante and Ibiza so both are good warm waters beach destinations.\nAlicante VS Ibiza for Luxury\nSome people might be looking for luxury in their holidays. It is true Ibiza is super famous and worldwide known. Ibiza’s name is all around songs and popular knowledge and some super-rich people dock their boats in Ibiza’s port for days.\nWhile Ibiza is better known for luxury than Alicante, the former, again, does not stay behind. Alicante’s coast has hundreds of ports, some of them big, where luxury boats can dock, 5-star hotels and expensive clubs.\nBut generally speaking clubs in Ibiza city are more luxury-focused than clubs in Alicante with more expensive reserved areas.\nAlicante or Ibiza for Living\nWhere you want to create your life is an important decision.\nIf your priority is the island vibe and its cosiness Ibiza has amazing weather, a lot of tourism and nice residential areas.\nIf you prefer to have easy access to travelling, good road and train connections and a big international airport in a privileged and nice area of Spain Alicante is the place to go.\nIf you want to raise a family Alicante has excellent international schools. Keep in mind, that both Alicante and Ibiza are part of Autonomous communities where there is another official language apart from Spanish -Catalan- and it is mandatory to be studied at school.\nMany expect that start living in Ibiza and then decide to move to Alicante province as being in Mainland Spain has also important advantages.\nWhat makes Alicante and Ibiza similar?\nBoth cities have a port and medieval heritage – Santa Barbara Castle in Alicante and Castillo de Ibiza in Ibiza-.\nAlicante and Ibiza areas have a similar shape and nature such as mountains, pine forests and general drylands (Ibiza being a bit more humid).\nBoth areas have a lot of spread out population being Alicante way more populated and having bigger cities than Ibiza.\nBeaches and coves are similar too as both areas have astonishing nature to explore next to the sea.\nAlicante Compared to Other Cities\nIf you want to more about how Alicante compares with other cities check these articles:\nAlicante VS Malaga\nAlicante VS Valencia\nMoving to Alicante VS London"

    "content_text": "Halloween is a new tradition in Alicante, Spain , but Todos Los Santos , on the 1st of November, has been around for ages. Let’s go to see the differences and how Alicantinians are embracing Hallowing.\nHalloween is a big festivity in most English-speaking countries. The influence of that cultural party has been exported to Spain through films, costume parties, business opportunities and foreigners living in the country. But this is not how Spaniards originally celebrated Halloween.\nContents\nToggle\nDía de Todos los Santos\nThe traditional day Spaniards celebrate Halloween is the 1st of November and it is called El dia de todos Los Santos which translates into The Day of All Saints. The actual American and English tradition has their origins in this old Spanish one.\nThere are many traditions that some people, mostly older people, follow. One of the biggest is going to the cemetery to visit their loved ones that are not between us anymore. People would go and give them a beautiful bouquet of flowers to show their respects and remind them they will never be forgotten. They usually like spending time with the family as well. They would go to the countryside or enjoy some hot chestnuts.\nSome Special Sweet For the Occasion you Should Try\nThere are some sweets that are important for this day like Huesos de Santo which translates to Bones of Saints. They are traditionally prepared only in this period of the year.\nHomemade Huesos de Santo (left) and Buñuelos con Crema (right)\nOther typical sweet is buñuelos con crema . They are little sweet and fried balls made of flour (mainly) and filled up with cream made of milk, eggs and corn flour.\nThere are a few other traditions. A good summary is on the Spanish embassy in the USA website.\nHalloween is a Bank Holiday in Spain\nAll Saints’ Day is a national bank holiday day so it is even easier to celebrate Halloween night and el día de todos Los Santos .\nIn Spain, there are 3 types of bank holidays: national, regional and city bank holidays.\nThe Spanish call festivo to the bank holidays. An example of national bank holidays are Todos los Santos (Halloween) on the 1st of November , Navidades (Christmas) on the 25th of December and a few others.\nExamples of regional bank holidays are Andalucia’s Day on the 28th of February or Valencian Community Day on the 9th of October, which Alicante also celebrates.\nA couple of examples of the city’s bank holidays would be the 28th of April to celebrate Santa Faz in Alicante or the 19th of August as the day Malaga was incorporated into the Castillian Cron.\nHalloween in Alicante\nWhat is more Spanish than joining all parties?\nAs a general rule, in Alicante and in Spain people love celebrations and parties. There is a very wise meme saying “They say Halloween is not a Spanish party, but what is more Spanish than joining all parties?”. Jokes apart, Hallowing has been growing as a party on the 31st of October at a quick pace. You can expect parties, people in customers and city-hall organised events all around the city centre . AlicanteOut.com has a few of them where you can assist. Pumpkins are not as present as they would be in other countries but they are still not impossible to find in supermarkets. So don’t be shy if you like to prepare them to put some candles on it.\nHalloween in Alicante is a sort of big party, more and more year after year so you can expect it to be this year as big as it has ever been. Don’t be scared by the people you will find on the streets, organizing a party at your house or going to any other organized party. Spaniards will love it.\nIf you really want to be an Alicantinian expert you can drive to the nearby city of Concentaina. It is 37mi (60km) away from Alicante. They prepare a concentration called Feria de todos Los Santos or Fair of All Saints. It is the second oldest fair in Spain. You can expect agricultural expositions, food, children’s activities, traditional Arabic and Christian markets and many other traditional activities and spectacles. It is a bit of a living story as it started in 1346. More info is on this Wikipedia page and on its official website.\nTruco o Trato\nYes, you guessed it, Truco o Trato translates to Trick or Treat . Everyone in Spain knows how it works thanks to the movies. The tradition of children going from house to house to ask for sweets is not as big as in the United States. Anyway, it is not weird to find some children doing it since 5 years ago or so. In my family, you can expect us to be ready if some children ring the bell to say in beautiful Spanish and costumes “ Truco o trato “.\nAs you can see, if your country celebrates Halloween Alicante and Spain will make you feel at home. You will enjoy the advantage of the bank holidays. You will taste delicious food. People dressing up everywhere will be everywhere around the centre.

    "content_text": "Alicante is a beautiful city in the province with the same name, in south-east Spain. There are many reasons why Alicante is worth visiting:\nAlicante is worth visiting for its history, heritage, culture , castle , picturesque beauty, mile-long beaches , coves, island , restaurants, contained prices, nightlife, good weather all year around, charming old town, landscape, sunsets, mosaic promenade, friendly people, shopping, festivals , golf courses , festivities, parties, coastline, transport to other pretty Costa Blanca destinations , the relaxed vibe… and more.\nSanta Barbara Castle from Gran Sol\nLet’s get into details on what makes Alicante special and why is it worth visiting.\nContents\nToggle\nThe City’s Charm\nSanta Barbara Castle From Herminta de Santa Cruz Viewpoint\nAlicante is truly a charming and pretty city.\nIt has its own traditional Spanish old town at the hillside of Santa Barbara castle that gets straight to El Postiguet beach .\nThe palm trees around the city make many corners of the city exotic and pretty. The pomegranate La Explanada is a perfect place for one of the most loved hobbies of the Spaniards: pasear which means “going for a walk”.\nThe modern city grew in between two mountains (each having a castle on the top). El Benacantil ( Santa Barbara Castle ) and El Tossal (San Fernando Castle). This unique setup creates a lot of spots in the city to enjoy the landscape.\nThe light in the Mediterranean is truly different to the light in other places, such as London . Most of the days are sunny and it is, usually, humid and warm. A perfect combination to brighten up all the typical brown, red, green and blue colours in the city.\nThe feeling when you are in Alicante is relaxed and comfortable. It has a good public transport system, like the bus for nearby destinations and the TRAM to enjoy the rest of Costa Blanca, like on a day trip to Benidorm .\nEverywhere in the city is accessible: the nice restaurants, the beaches, the rooftops, the shops, the landscape spots… easy and compacted city to enjoy around.\nThe Beaches\nEl Postiguet Beach\nThe beaches in Alicante are, simply put, astonishing.\nThe main beach in Alicante is El Postiguet . It is just down from Santa Barbara Castle and next to the traditional city centre El Barrio .\nEl Postiguet is not the biggest beach in the city but quite accessible and pretty.\nAdditionally, San Juan Beach is arguably the best beach in Alicante. It merges into El Campello Beach Muchavista through an invisible line that makes it one of the longest beaches in Spain. The beach is inside an urban beach with golden sand.\nThere are volleyball nets, chiringuitos and watersports centres opening in summer if your objective is not just tanning and swimming.\nOn the other side, if you prefer less urbanized spaces then Alicante got it too. El Cabo de Las Huertas in San Juan is perfect if you like coves and rocky beaches. In there, you can almost forget that people tend to build houses and enjoy the open sea views.\nIf rocky beaches are not for you but still want to enjoy less urbanized sandy beaches Alicante City got you again. Urbanova is a semi-urbanised sandy beach. In Between Urbanova and Arenales (Elche’s beach), there is a perfect space with dunes to enjoy more of a virgin (and, by the way, naturist) beach.\nBut the surprises are not done yet. Another extremely special place to swim and tan is Tabarca Island . It has beaches and coves and it is just an astonishing place to go to. The island is just another neighbourhood of Alicante so you don’t really leave the city.\nIf your trip is set in winter the beaches can be enjoyed too. They open all year around and the weather in winter is warm enough for walks on the beach’s shores. Volleyball nets are open all year around and nearby restaurants open as well on beaches such as El Postiguet and San Juan (but not the chiringuitos ).\nThe Culture\nIf cuteness and beaches are not your priorities when choosing a destination Alicante, again, got you.\nThere are more than 8 museums in the city of Alicante (including a museum on the tiny Tabarca island , yes).\nThe museum’s showroom exhibits are a mix of Arqueological history (Alicante has been inhabited since prehistory, with remains found dating +6000 years old), art, water history and local traditions among others.\nAncient remains near Alicante\nThere is a complete article about the museums in Alicante here. A short summary:\nGo to MARQ Museum if you are interested in the history told through the archaeological remains\nGo to the MUBAG if you like fine arts\nTo MACA if you like modern art\nBook an Air Raid Settler visit if you want to learn more about the Spanish Civil War (WWII period)\nGo to Hogueras de San Juan Museum if you want to learn about the main bonfire festival in Alicante\nAguas De Alicante if you want to learn about the water history in such a dry area as Alicante\nVisit The Ocean Race Museum if you want to learn about the round-the-world sailing bouts regatta that starts from Alicante\nMUSA museum teaches you about modern history in Alicante\nYou can also visit archaeological sites managed by MARQ showing the first Alicante city created by the Iberians and then transformed by the Romans called Lucentum , or get the TRAM train to Campello (line 3) to visit another site called Illeta dels Banyets with a city that was populated through the prehistory to the Muslin occupation in the Middle Age and has an ancient roman fish farm . Quite unique in Europe only finding remains in Alicante and Italy.\nThe Food \u0026 Restaurants\nAlicante is quite a good city for food too.\nThe restaurant scene is dynamic with new openings every so often. Many types of food are found: traditional Spanish, traditional Alicantininan, burger chains, fast food, Asian, Italian, French and many others.\nThere are indeed two restaurants with Michelin Stars distinctions in the city of Alicante (in Spanish):\nSteky with fusion food\nAnd Tabula Rasa, with traditional Spanish food offers\nBut Michelin-starred restaurants are not the only high-quality restaurants.\nUsing apps such as The Fork , Google Maps or others is an excellent way to find the type of restaurant matching your needs and budget. But in case you want some local recommendations I will leave them here.\nLocal Restaurants Recommendations\nA good piece of advice is to try to have food for lunch or dinner at Spanish times (1-3 pm for lunch and +9pm for dinner. This way it is easier to avoid the tourist traps (yes, Alicante has tourist traps too).\nSomething special to do in Alicante is going to a rooftop restaurant or bar .\nFor example, El Gran Sol hotel building has amazing rooftop views restaurant . Or if you want to enjoy a drink then La Milagrosa Rooftop features spectacular views of the Santa Barbara Castle . However there are more recommendations in the rooftop bars and restaurants in Alicante’s article.\nPaella and Arroces\nAnd here goes a pro tip that it is important to know if you had in mind eating paella: In Alicante, the tradition is not to prepare paella but what we just call Arroz (it means rice). The dish is similar to paella -it is done in the same wide and short pan- but prepared slightly differently.\nThe main Arroz variant will remind similar to paella where you can have arroz con marisco , arroz mixto , arroz mixto (vegetables and meat), arrod de verdura (viwth vegetables wich is vegetarian and vegan)… but you can also try things such as arroz con costra , olleta alicantina (rice in a soap), arroz a banda , Caldero (if you go to Tabarca ) and others.\nEssentially, there is a choice for everyone in Alicante: budget food restaurants, expensive and excellent quality food restaurants, rooftop restaurants and bars , chiringuitos and next-to-the-sea restaurants… It will match everyone with a lot of options for all dietary needs and preferences. By the way, there are good options for vegetarian and vegan restaurants too and, virtually any restaurant, can sort out dishes if you are vegetarian or vegan and didn’t have it on the menu.\nOther Foods You Should Try\nAnd here are some extra recomendations for your trip to Alicante in a form of a list:\nCoca de Mollitas\nCoca Antoñina\nChurros con chocolate in Chocolateria Valor\nCocas de verduras/de atun y cebolla/sardina salada\nEmpanadillas de pisto/atun\nMona de Pascua (in Easter)\nTurrones (Christmas)\nThe Expenses\nAlicante is -still- a relatively cheap city. For example:\nA bottle of beer can cost around 3/4€ in most bars (nightclubs will cost more)\nA cheap meal can start at 10€ and a good meal ranges from 15€-30€\nA single TRAM or bus ticket costs 1.45€, being the cost of travel cards much lower\nA taxi from Alicante Airport to Alicante costs around 30€-35€ ( the airport bus is way cheaper , 3.85€)\nHotels and hostel rooms can range from as little to 25€ a double room to luxury rooms costing +100€, so there is something for every budget.\nThe Nightlife\nAlicante’s nightlife is vivid.\nWhatever you want to dance and listen to -from Latin music to techno- Alicante got you sorted. The centre is lively essentially all day until night at 3 am, where most of the clubs need to close by law (except for the after-hours nightclubs).\nRemember the Spaniards like having dinner late (around 9 pm-10 pm) and going to parties late too. It is not unusual to meet your friends at 12 pm to then go to the clubs. But there is now a somewhat new tradition of going tardeo , which translates to “evening-ing” (makes more sense in Spanish).\nThis novel concept in Spain means meeting your friends in the evening to have some drinks and then going and having dinner before going back home. This usually happens in the party area Castaños . Some of the clubs stay open until late at night too.\nLet’s go deeper into Alicante’s party zones, we have 4. This doesn’t mean there are no clubs or pubs in other places around the city but there are 4 main distinguishable areas:\nEl Barrio (part of the traditional quarter)\nCastaños (for Tardeo and night clubs)\nEl Puerto (nightclubs, Latin music places , Karaoke and after-hours)\nSan Juan Beach and el Golf Area (more lively in summer)\nAs accessible as Alicante is, all the party areas except for San Juan Beach/El Golf are accessible by just walking between them in 5/15 minutes.\nThe Festivities And Festivals\nThe Spanish are known for their festivals and parties and Alicantininas are far from being left behind. Actually, they lead the way up at some parties.\nThe most important festivity of Alicante is Hogueras de San Juan .\nIt is a massive festival happening at the end of June (19-24th).\nHoguera at Hogueras Festival in Alicante\nFor almost a week, the city centre is closed to cars. The streets become museum showrooms of massive sculptures… that are burned on the last day of the party:\nHuge flames come out from the gigantic bonfires while the firefighters control they don’t burn anything that should not be burned (such as the neighbouring houses and trees).\nThis is called “La Banya” and the firefighters will soak in water any brave person staying in the trajectory of their hose.\nBut it is not the only important festivity in Alicante.\nEaster, Christmas and Moros y Cristianos are celebrated with all the enthusiasm they deserve, including Los Reyes Mago s. For more about the weather and what to do in December click here.\nShould you visit the city on any of these dates you will be able to live the experience of the Spanish traditions in all their glory.\nThere are also music festivals and others happening in Alicante or nearby. Such as the Low Festival in Benidorm, for example.\nTrips to The Rest of The Costa Blanca\nThe city of Alicante is inside the province of Alicante (yes, it has the same name). The coast of Alicante’s province is called Costa Blanca .\nThe public transport to other places in Costa Blanca, such as Benidorm , Altea and others is done through the TRAM trains and busses .\nThe TRAM train is an experience in itself. The track route is +100 years old and passes by many nearby sea mountainous scenery.\nIt is not the most efficient means of transport for longer distances, such as Alicante to Benidorm ( coaches from Alicante are faster ), but if you have the time, then the views are amazing and worth the trip.\nThe Golf Courses And Nearby Theme Parks\nAlicante has also major entertainment venues such as Golf Courses or theme parks outside the city but accessible by the TRAM train .\nIf you like water then Aqualandia is your place. It is situated in Bendiorm but it is accessible by the tram from Alicante and then using a local bus.\nTerra Mitica is a theme park. It has proper roller coasters and many other rides for brave (and unbrave) people.\nFor young children, you visit Mundo Mar, a place with water animals. Or Terra Natura.\nAnd if you like golf there are courses in the city of Alicante: Alicante Golf and El Plantio, but more about golf courses in the city of Alicante in this article .\nStaying Longer in Alicante\nMaybe you are actually thinking of moving to Alicante. Spending a longer period of time in the city instead of just visiting can be quite a pleasant experience. If you want to know more, here are some of Alicante’s Pros and Cons and here is how does compare Alicante to London .\nAlicante is a great city not only for visiting but for living too. It is, for now, not too expensive and offers a high quality of life with many activities to do and surprisingly good weather all year around, even in winter ."

    "content_text": "Short answer: yes. You can safely drink water from the tap anywhere in Spain. If the water is not drinkable it will be properly informed with a sing. In case of rare and really extreme weather conditions, there might be temporal restrictions to tap water, announced by the city hall and the press. But let’s go into more details about drinkable tap water in Alicante.\nContents\nToggle\nShould I Drink Tap Water in Alicante?\nTap water in Alicante is safe and potable. Its quality is regulated by European and Spanish laws as in all European countries. The company that provides the water is called Aguas de Alicante and they have been around in its current legal shape since 1953 . They follow all the processes in the regulation. To do so, they are ISO regulated by the relevant standardization norms. They offer the results of the analysis at the bottom of this page.\nThe places where the water is not drinkable are announced by a “forbidden to drink” sign. The Spanish translation of “non-drinking water” is Agua no potable . Always look for it if you are drinking water from a public space, like a fountain.\nIn case of rare and extreme weather conditions, some towns and areas might have forbidden the use of tap water for drinking or cooking during a period of time. That is very extreme and unusual and the media will make the population aware of the situation.\nWhere is the Drinking Water Coming from In Alicante?\nAlicante is situated in one of the aridest zones in Spain. Alicantinians have been very imaginative about how to get water since they started living in the area 7000 years ago . Santa Barbara Castle , for example, has several water facilities such as ancients water tanks. Today’s water comes from different sources being:\nRivers\nSubterranean water\nSeawater after being treated on a desalination plant\nAll this water is cleaned and treated before coming to your tap. The mix of water is different depending on aspects like the season and the needs of the network. Usually, in summer there is more percentage of water coming from the sea than in winter.\nDrinking-Water Flavour in Alicante\nThe flavour of the water can be very different from one city to another in Spain. Chances are that it will be very different from your country of origin. One of the reasons for this strong flavour is the different sources of water that reach the tap and the chlorine is used to clean it. The season and the amount of rain during the year will affect the mix. For example, winters waters will have a softer flavour than mid-August liquid.\nA local -kind of- popular trick for people who mind the flavour is using a filtering jar like, for example, this one . Let’s be honest, Alicante has chalky and hard water. The filtering jar will soften the flavour a little bit and remove some of the mineral salts on it.\nRelated Questions\nIs tap water safe to drink in Alicante?\nYes. Tap water is drinkable in Alicante.\nI hope I have answered the question Is Tap Water Drinkable in Alicante? .

    "content_text": "Alicante has several museums explaining the history and culture of the city and province of Alicante .\nEntrance to the Marq Museum\nThe MARQ Museum is an archaeological exhibition of objects of the province of Alicante corresponding to different Ages: Prehistory, Iberian, Roman, Middle Ages and Modern and Contemporary . Through the items, we get a good idea of the culture, economics and organization of the Alicantinian society in each era. There is a mixture of interactive screens, videos and audio descriptions available to the visitors.\nMARQ is one of the most important museums in the city. It is composed of the main exhibition building dated 1931 and several archaeological sites such as La Illeta and Lucentum .\nContents\nToggle\nMARQ Museum\nThe current MARQ museum uses an old hospital building dating from 1931 and was opened in 2000.\nIt has space for 6 main permanent displays, a couple of archaeological excavation replicas and temporary expositions.\nThe 6 permanent rooms are:\nPrehistory\nEntrance to the Prehistory exhibition at MARQ Alicante\nThis permanent room exhibits objects from the prehistory period, starting around 100,000 years ago to the VIII BC century. There are more than a thousand objects from different societies from back then: hunter-gatherers, farmers and herders and the early metallurgists.\nThe end of this period (VIII BC) is considered to have happened when the indigenous villages entered into contact with the Phoenicians which developed into the Iberian culture.\nIberians\nEntrance to the Iberians exhibition at MARQ Alicante\nDuring this period, VI-I centuries BC, Alicantinian lands were populated by the Contestants. One of the legacies left by them is La Dama de Cabezo Lucero, a sculpture of a woman with a fancy hairstyle and jewellery.\nDama de Cabezo Lucero IV BC. in MARQ Alicante\nIt dates from the IV BC century and has a relationship with Dama de Elche , another important heritage of the neighbouring city of Elche.\nIn this room, you can learn about the Iberian culture, the Contestants, their economics, artisans and social structures, their religion and relationship with death and more.\nRomans\nEntrance to the Roman exhibition at MARQ Alicante\nThe Roman exhibition talks about the arrival of Roman culture and its influence in the province, Christianism and the late Roman period.\nThe Romans founded the city of Lucentum. It is situated in Albufereta, close to the Albufereta beach and it is called T ossal de Manises .\nLucentum-Tosssal de Manises Roman City\nThe evidence of this period is not only found at Lucentum but in different places around Alicante, such as Castillo de Santa Barbara which dates from the IX AD century but had items from the Romans in its mountainside.\nMedieval Age\nEntrance to the Medieval exhibition at MARQ Alicante\nThe Medieval Room exhibits evidence of the different cultures that inhabited Alicante during the 8 centuries of this period: Islam, Christianity, and Judaism.\nThe city was totally immersed in the development happening in Medieval Europe.\nModern Era\nEntrance to the Modern Era exhibition at MARQ Alicante\nThe last period analysed in this museum is the modern and contemporary culture, from 1500 to 1931.\nThere are two main blocks in the exhibition: the cron power from 1500 to 1808 and the constitutional regime from 1808 to 1874.\nIn this final room, we can learn about the origins of Alicante as we know it nowadays.\nOther Expositions\nApart from the 5 big rooms corresponding to the 5 historical periods in Alicante, there are a few other expositions and pieces at the MARQ Museum main corridor.\nThe two expositions show how archaeological sites are dug. One is a land site while the other one is a submarine site.\nSubmarine Archaeological Site Exposition at MARQ Museum Alicante\nTemporary Expositions\nThe MARQ museum makes an effort to exhibit a number of temporary expositions per year.\nFrom the 26th of March to the 13th of October 2024 the itinerant exhibition in place is “ Dynastys. The first kingdoms of prehistoric Europe “\nThe exhibition has 482 pieces from a total of 20 museums and museum institutions in Spain, Hungary, Slovakia, Germany, Belgium, Portugal and Denmark.\nMARQ Museum Location\nThe MARQ museum address is: Plaza Doctor Gómez Ulla (no street number), 03013, Alicante\nBus to MARQ Museum\nThe bus lines stopping at the MARQ Museum are: 2, 6, 9, 20 y 23\nTRAM to MARQ Museum\nThe TRAM lines stopping at the MARQ museum are 1, 3 and 4. The stop is called MARQ-Castillo .\nMarq Museum Schedule\nMarq Museum Winter Schedule:\nMarq Museum Schedule\nMARQ Archaeological Sites\nThere are also a few archaeological sites that are part of the MARQ Museum. They are extremely important to understand the story of Alicante.\nTossal de Maminses – Lucentum\nThis is arguably the most important site in Alicante as it is considered the ancient city of Alicante.\nEntrance Lucentum\nIt used to be a human settlement in the Iberian period. After a few centuries, the settlement mutated into a Roman city and it was called Lucentum .\nThe name Lucentum is well incorporated into the current Alicantinian culture. There is a basketball team with the name and a fair amount of businesses and brands with the name.\nThe ancient city is rounded by about 600 meters of defensive walls. It is nearby La Albufereta Beach 3.5km away from the current city centre of Alicante .\nThe first signs of occupation in Lucentum date from the 5th century BC but it was in the 3rd century BC when the defensive walls and towers were built shaping the later Roman city.\nThe second Punic War , around the year 200 BC, affected the city that was almost destroyed. It had to wait until the end of the II century BC to start a strong rebuild where the walls were reinforced, created new defensive towers and the overall defensive system was improved.\nIn the mid-1st century BC, Augusto was the emperor of the Roman Empire. Lucentum got the status of “municipium” which gave a few extra rights to the city in the empire’s structure such as the right of self-governance and some other Roman legal structures. At this point in history, the city received the name Lucentum .\nRoman Baths in Lucentum Alicante\nIn the 1st century BC and the 1st century AD, the city grew into a traditional and prosperous Roman city. Typical buildings and structures were built: the forum, Roman baths, sewage system, and a temple… the city even grew and extended outside its original walls.\nSadly, at the end of the 1st century, AD Lucentum started its final decadence period and the citizens vanished in the III AD century due to economic and regional dynamics.\nThe city was used then as a stone quarry for nearby constructions for a long time. During the VIII and X AD centuries, the area was used by the Muslims as an Islamic cemetery.\nThe archaeological site was declared Monumento Histórico-Artístico or Monument of Historic and Artistic Importance in 1961.\nHow to Get to Lucentum\nLucentum is situated on Calle Zeus, 03016, Alicante .\nThe bus line to get to Lucentum is 09 and the stop is called Zeus 3.\nThe closest TRAM stop is Albufereta on lines 1, 3, 4 and 5.\nLa Illeta dels Banyets\nThis is an important archaeological site with remains dating from the prehistoric period.\nEntrance to La Illeta dels Banyet\nBack in the time, when the site was populated, it was a peninsula. In an unknown year, the peninsula was cut from the mainland due to an earthquake. In 1943, it was transformed into a peninsula again but not without polemic as some evidence of the remains was destroyed in the process.\nThe location is in the nearby town of El Campello , around 9km from Alicante’s city centre.\nIn this little peninsula, there are reminders of many cultures and epochs, starting from prehistory, we have reminders from the Bronze Age, Iberians, a Roman city and the Muslim occupation in the Middle Ages.\nRemains Illeta dels Banyet\nAnother interesting remaining is from the Roman period. They built a little fish farm on the sea. With 4 ponds it has two channels to refresh the water from seawater. The ponds are communicated with vertical slots that could be closed using doors.\nFish Farm Remains Illeta dels Banyet\nThere are only remains of this type of fish farm in the province of Alicante and some areas in Italy.\nIf it is summer, there is another interesting activity to do in this place. The fish farm is free entrance and swimming is permitted.\nIf you wish to do some snorkelling there is a pretty route going around the little peninsula, including the fish farm.\nSnorkel Route in Illeta Dels Banyets\nHow to Get to Illeta Dels Banyets\nLa Illeta Dels Banyets address is Partida Almadrava, 03560 El Campello, Alicante , 15 km from Alicante city centre.\nBy TRAM , you can use the TRAM line 1 to Benidorm and take off on Poble Espanyol to then walk for about 15 minutes.\nAnother option is to use the TRAM line 3 to Campello and take off at the last stop with the same name: Campello. It takes about 18 minutes to walk to the archaeological site.\nBy bus , line number 21 does the route Alicante-Campello.\nFor either the bus or TRAM you don’t need to pay extra zones to get to Campello, just the same ticket or travel card used elsewhere in the city of Alicante.\nOther Archaeological Sites Managed by the MARQ Museum\nThere are two more archaeological sites managed by the museum MARQ.\nThese are further away and the public transport to get there is non-existent.\nLa Cova de L’Or, in the town Beniarres, is a cove used by our Neolithic fellas. To visit, it is necessary to book in advance a guided visit.\nThe timetable is Saturday and Sunday from 9 am to 2 pm. The fee is 5€.\nSantuario de Pla de Petracos , in the town Castell de Castells , is a site of Macroschematic Art. The visits are guided: Monday to Thursday you need to book on +34 965 518 067. On Friday and Saturday, the visits are 11am to 13pm and 17am to 18pm.\nYou can book the visits on the MARQ museum or on their website ."

    "content_text": "There are many pros and cons of living in each of the cities and countries. Alicante in Spain and London in the UK are very different cities but both of them allow you to vibrate in their different but intense buzzes.\nMoving to Alicante VS London\nContents\nToggle\nPros of Moving To Alicante\n1. Surprisingly Good Weather All Year Around\nAlicante is in southeast Spain , touching the Mediterranean sea with more than 10 beaches in the city . It is also protected by high mountains such as Maigmo .\nThis unique location and characteristics make Alicante one of the cities in Spain with the most sunshine all year around. Winters are mild and summers are less suffocating than in other cities in the south or central Spain. Only 27% of the time Alicante is covered by clouds in the worst months as per weather-atlas.com\nThe coldest month in the city is January, with an average temperature of 12°C (54°F) but an average of a whopping 17°C (62.6°F) in the sunny mornings. The hottest month is August with a max average of 30.8°C (87.44°F) and lows of 21.2°C (70.16°F).\n2. Many Parks, Natural Areas and Beaches\nThere are many good natural spaces for walks, exercising, enjoyment of views and also many playgrounds for children. Every beach in Alicante has a children’s playground (or several) so they are perfect spaces for adult walks and children’s recreation.\nThere are parks such as El Palmerar with chiringuitos that can enjoy all kinds of personal and age stages from children to the elderly and the young adults and adults in between.\nPlaces such as Santa Barbara and San Fernando castles are perfect for a Sunday stroll as much as San Juan Beach or El Palmeral park.\nIn Alicante, there are more than 10 beaches where you can just go on foot which are very enjoyable in both summer and winter.\n3. Lot of Quality and Inexpensive Restaurants\nSpain’s nightlife is very active. Traditionally, having to deal with the high temperatures in summer allowed the night to be an active part of the day.\nIn Alicante, there are many restaurants. Whether you prefer vegetarian modern cuisine or taste the most traditional Mediterranean food such as the Arroces (or paellas) or just a quick dirty burger Alicante has it all. Spanish, Thailand, Luxury, Vegetarian, Indian… you name it and you find it in Alicante. At-good-prices.\n4. Lot of Hiking Trails Near By\nApart from the urban trails such as in Santa Barbara castle , Serra Grossa and Cabo de San Juan there are many mountains and hiking spaces all around the city. Many of them are accessible by car and some just by walking or mountain cycling.\n5. The Nightlife\nAlicante has a surprisingly vivid nightlife taking into account its size. If you like latin dancing such as Salsa and Bachata , Alicante is a good city for you.\nMany other nightclubs in Alicante El Barrio, Castaños or San Juan mix the music and you can find a lot of Reggaeton and other Spanish-international pop music.\nThe international vibe is also present with places such as El Refugio , The Robins Pub and El Bunker featuring live music on certain days of the week, many times in English too.\nIf you rather prefer another type of music such as techno you have your options too in places such as Artespiritu or Level Club .\n6. Alicante Not an Expensive City\nAlicante is still one of those places where prices as not as crazy as they might be in a few years. Going out in Alicante is affordable for both food and nightlife but housing in Alicante is also cheaper than in many other cities. A lot of hotel and hostel options. Good Airbnb offers sensible prices for renting and buying properties… Let’s see how long this holds true!\n7. Local and International Transport\nIt is very easy to travel to/from Alicante as it has one of the busiest airports in Spain. International connections by plane are surprisingly good.\nBut Alicante has also a train station , including high-speed trains. Travelling to Madrid takes only 2:40h by train and to Barcelona around 1h by plane.\nDestinations such as Rekiavick, Helsinki, Paris, London and many many many others are only a few pounds or Euros away.\nAlso, the transport in the area is very good with bus and TRAM connections to many places in the province. It is very easy to go from Alicante to Benidorm or the Airport to Torrevieja by coach .\n8. Friendly City\nThis always depends on every person’s experience but, in general, Alicante is an easy welcoming city with nice people.\nMany years ago, the people in the costa Blanca and in Alicante -in particular- started to open Spain to tourism.\nThe idea of foreigners being a source of openness and economic success has stuck in the people for decades. Alicantinians are naturally inclined to be open and nice but this idea of development has stuck in the already warmness of the people in Alicante making it a good city to integrate into.\n9. Good Hospitals and Health Systems\nSpanish health system works quite well when you compare it with others in other countries. It is free to use if you are a resident and hospitals for emergencies are available to anyone.\nThere are also private hospitals and good clinics such as for eye surgery or assisted reproduction.\n17. Hogueras Festival and Other Festivities\nEach city in Spain has its own festivity. In Alicante, it is called Hogueras de San Juan and it is a 5 days festival 29-24 of June where the city shuts down into a museum of huge sculptural bonfires that are burned on the last day of the festival. Pretty awesome.\nApart from the festival, you have Santa Faz , Moros y Cristianos and easy access to the festivities of nearby cities and towns such as La Tomatina in Buñol.\nCons of Moving to Alicante\n1. Work Opportunities\nAlicante is not the best city for work. It is perfect if you can work from home or are a digital nomad but otherwise salaries and job opportunities are not high in Alicante. Plus not so many international companies have landed their offices in the city. At least yet. Salaries might be a bit low too, in the line with the still relatively cheapest cost of living.\n3. Traffic\nAlicante is transforming into a more dependent on public transport and bikes city. But it is not there yet. The bus in Alicante has still some basic deficiencies such as a good bus tracking system and apps to calculate your fastest route. What is in place now is quite basic and fails a lot. Many people still depend on the car in the city, especially if they don’t live in the centre area.\n4. Hills, Uphills and Downhills\nIt is part of how the city has grown. Everywhere there is a downhill or uphill as Alicante is in between 3 hills: El Benacantil ( Santa Barbara Castle ), El Tossal (San Fernando Castle) and Serra Grossa (in between Alicante centre and Alicante San Juan Beach ).\nNo way to avoid them and it doesn’t matter where in the city you live or stay in. The good news is that, in most places, slopes are not very extreme.\n5. Valenciano\nIf you are a tourist or adult you don’t have to worry about this. Valenciano is a minority language in the autonomous community Alicante belongs to. There are some legal requirements for this language in official bodies and for civil servants but its implementation varies from town to town and, in Alicante, it is not widely used by hardly anyone.\nThe only moment when it needs to worry you is when you have children at school ages. Valenciano is mandatory to be studied and, depending on the school, some subjects will happen totally in Valenciano so try informing yourself before deciding schools.\n6. Flooding Rain\nIn Alicante, it doesn’t rain much at all. But when it does, it is usually heavy rain.\nThe end of the summer -September-October- is usually the rainy season in the city. In the early 00′ the Cityhall used a lot of money into making Alicante a safe city in heavy rainfalls. The city now is safe but chances are the rains will completely disrupt your life for 3 or 4 days per year. The rest of the winter is calmer, warm and sunny .\nPros of Moving to London\n1. Excellent Work Market\nIt is very easy to find a job in London, especially, if you are in the IT sector. Depending on your industry, high salaries can be offered in London. The market is dynamic and the British culture helps to pursue your professional career.\n2. Every Culture is In London\nIf you like meeting new people and different cultures London is the perfect city for you. There is a huge amount of people with extremely different backgrounds living together. It is easy to mix if that’s what you are looking for. Virtually everything can be found in the city.\n3. Near the Best International Connexions\nThere are 6 airports serving mainly London: Heathrow, London City, London Gatwick, London Luton, London Stansted and even London Southend. It is probably the city in Europe with the best connections to the rest of the continent and the rest of the world. You can’t compete against this.\n4. Public Transport\nIf you live in London there is 0 need for a car. Transport during the day is just above and beyond the underground. You can get anywhere in the city in around 1h, even to the furthest zones that might be miles away from where you are now.\nNight transport is also quite good with some Underground lines working 24h on some days, the extensive night bus service or the well-tuned Uber and taxis network.\nTrains will get you to further places too, such as Brighton or Oxford.\n5. Parks\nThe city is massive it has massive parks too. Not only Hyde Park or Green Park is perfect for a picnic but also other parks such as Hampstead Heath are quite literally a forest inside the city.\n6. Events, Concerts, Gigs, Markets…\nLondon is, essentially, one of the greatest cities for events. From Elrow to concerts from international stars, to local stars coming to perform in front of their diasporas in London… Small gigs, organised thematic nights, Sunday street markets… a bit of everything all the time.\nElrow Festival In London\n7. Free Culture\nOne of the many amazing things about London is its heritage, in all senses. From Roman walls remains to the impressive museums with valuable art from all around the world coming from its imperialist age.\nThe amount of free cultural activities in this city is insane. If you are into this type of entertainment London is your city.\n8. Christmas, Summer and Other Festivities\nIn London, there are many festivities that are quite impressive. Christmas is one of the best with ice skating rings popping up all around the city, mulled wine, winter wonderlands and Christmas markets making this period magical.\nThe Guy Fawkes Night or fireworks night, Nottinghill carnival, gay pride… it is not easy to get bored in London.\n9. Free Health System\nEven though you can argue that the Spanish health system is more useful to the citizens than the NHS (Spain does more preventive medicine) the hospitals, GPs and other specialists do a good job and it is free to use.\nCons of Moving to London\n1. London is Extremely Expensive\nIt is one of the most expensive cities in Europe. A night out is an easy £80 if you pay for dinner, club entrance and some drinks. Food is not that expensive compared with other cities but the rest is way more expensive. The Underground, as good as it is, costs a lot of money even if you move between your underground zone. And that is a fixed cost even before you reach your destination.\n2. Housing Market\nTo rent a room or to buy a property is not only extremely expensive but it is a difficult and extreme competition.\nSome people pay deposits even before seeing the room and housing offer left the market extremely fast. Either you try to be very quick or are willing to pay to overrate or your chances to get a good place to live are low.\n3. Everything Has to be Planned in Advance\nIt is not only that people are busy but the city itself is always super busy. Do you want to go to a Spanish restaurant? Book in advance or you will have to wait at least 30 min before being fitted. Do you want to enter a club at night? Well, book in advance or chances is that you will need to overpay if you are lucky enough to be allowed in. Everything follows the same dynamic.\n4. Grey, Wet and Windy Changing Weather\nLondon is a gorgeous but grey city. Even the best month in London (as per weatherspark.com data ), July, just 58% of the days will have clear skies. Only with an average of 26% of clear days in December!\nRain, showers and wind are also common in this city. Even though snow is not common it can snow too.\nAlso, it is common to start the day sunny and end up the day of training. The weather can change a lot in a short period of time.\n5. The City is Massive\nDistances in London are huge. The city follows a typical anglo-Saxon style of houses and 1 to 2 floors flats where the density of people living is very low. Yes, there are a few skyscrapers for flats and taller buildings now but this is more recent. So the result is the need of using the underground at all times and your friends living 15km (9.3mi) away from you. Also, most of the fun is concentrated in a few centres around the city.\n6. Supermarkets\nEven though it is possible to find all types of foods in London and some of the foods at good prices there is an area where London can not compete with Mediterranean cities such as Alicante: fruits, vegetables and fish.\nAll types of vegetables, fruits and other foods can be found but the prices will be way higher than in Alicante and with a significantly lower quality. London just can not compete with the quality.\n7. Transport Disruptions\nWages, engineering issues, planned closures, extreme weather conditions… It is wise to always check online your route before you jump into the underground and trains as it is extremely common to find any kind of disruption to the services. It is very easy to be late to your destination if you don’t check in advance.\n8. Childcare\nIt is extremely expensive to use childcare services such as nurseries or any other private childcare. When the children grow up a bit education such as schools is free but if you want to go to any private school or uni it gets extremely expensive."

    "content_text": "In Alicante, there are a few public-founded swimming pools. Those are quite good for doing sport, improving your swimming abilities or just going for a swim. Let’s go to see where they are and their characteristics.\nMonte Tossal Indoors Swimming Pool\nIn Alicante, there are many public swimming pools but only 3 are managed and funded by the council (but all Alicante beaches are public and free to use). The prices are lower in comparison with privately owned swimming pools. They are located in 3 areas of the city far from each other.\nContents\nToggle\nList of Public Swimming Pools In Alicante\nPiscina Municipal Monte Tossal\nPiscina Municipal Luis Asensi Florida-Babel\nPiscina Municipal Via Parque\nSwimming Pool in Monte Tossal\nThe first indoor/outdoor swimming pool is located in Monte Tossal which translates into Tossal Hill (it is located, obviously, on the top of a hill). Its official name is José Antonio Chicoy and it is part of a bigger municipal sports centre. There are 2 swimming pools.\nMonte Tossal Outdoors Swimming Pool\nTossal Swimming Pool Schedule\nThe swimming pool schedule or timetable is:\nWeek Days Time Open Monday to Friday 8:00h to 21:15h Saturday to Sunday 8:00 to 11:30\n12:00 to 14:00 Tossal Swimming pool schedule\nIndoors Swimming Pool\nThe indoor swimming pool has a length of 25 meters and there are 8 lines available. The water temperature is controlled and 2 lines will be reserved for people using flippers. When there are programmed courses 2 or 3 lines will be closed for the people in the class while the rest of the swimming pool is open for solo swimmers.\nEvery now and then they will organise events and the public can assist and sit on its terraces.\nTossal Indoors Swimming Pool Schedule\nThe indoor swimming pool closes in summer to let swimmers use the outdoor swimming pool as per the official city hall announcement (in Spanish) .\nIn 2023, the indoor swimming pool will be closed from the 16th of June until early winter 2023.\nOutdoors Swimming Pool\nThe outdoor swimming pool is 50 meters long, Olympic-sized, and it will open only during summer. There is enough space to sunbathe on a towel in the terrace area. Inside the complex, there is a small swimming pool with a fountain in the middle. Perfect for children. The water temperature is not controlled but is warm in summer.\nOutdoor Swimming Pool at Tossal\nThis swimming pool is great for going by car as there is plenty of free parking space around. Every now and then a sports event will be happening and, for a few hours during the competition, parking would be impossible. It doesn’t often happen though.\nThere is also a small swimming pool with a fountain in the middle, perfect to enjoy with the family.\nSmall Outdoors Swimming Pool for Children\nTossal Outdoors Swimming Pool Schedule\nIn 2023, the outdoor swimming pool is going to be opened on the 5th of June; as per the official city hall announcement (in Spanish) until the 24th of September 2023. From the 25th of September 2023, the indoor pool will be opened again.\nThe public transport links are not the best. The only line that will leave you very near to the Monte Tossal swimming pool is line 39 . Another good option is line 05 which will drop you out ~8 minutes away on foot.\nIf you prefer to cycle, there is space for chaining your bike next to the main door.\nThis is the address: Calle Foguerer José Romeu Zarandieta, 2, 03005 Alicante, Spain . Click here to use Google Maps. Check the schedule on the official website .\nSwimming Pool Luis Asensi in La Florida-Babel\nCurrently closed. It reopens on the 11th of September 2023.\nThis indoor complex is smaller than Monte Tossal . There is only a 25-meter swimming pool with 6 lines. The water temperature is controlled and they have a sauna and jacuzzi that are usually broken and closed to the public. There are fast lines for using flippers and depending on the class schedule, some lines will be closed.\nLuis Asensi Swimming Pool\nEven having a private parking lot, there is less space for cars than in other pools as it is usually busy. Anyhow, it is still possible to find a spot after a few minutes of search. On the dedicated spots next to the main door , you can chain the bikes. The pool is well-connected by public transport. Here is a list of lines that will drop you next to the pool: 04 , 03 and 07 .\nLuis Asensi in La Florida-Babel Swimming Pool Schedule\nThe swimming pool is currently closed. It reopens on the 11th of September 2023.\nThe schedule is:\nWeek Days Time Open Monday to Friday 8:00 to 11:00\n11:30 to 16:30\n17:00 to 21:15 Saturday and Sunday 8:30 to 11:30\n12:00 to 14:00 Babel Swimming pool schedule\nThis is the address: Calle Fernando Madroñal, 2, 03007 Alicante, Spain . Click here to see the address in Google Maps. Finally, this is the official website with the schedule.\nSwimming Pool Vía Parque\n(closed from 5 of June 2023, it will reopen on the 10th of October 2023)\nThis indoor complex is bigger than Luis Asensi but smaller than Monte Tossal . The bonus is that the swimming pool is the newest in Alicante. It has 8 indoor lines with the water temperature being controlled. As in the other pools, some lines will be reserved for courses and fast swimmers using flippers.\nVia Parque Swimming Pool\nAs well, it has a private parking lot and it is, usually, easy to park around the area. They have spots for chaining the bikes and there are a couple of important bus lines stopping nearby: 03 and 04.\nSwimming Pool Schedule\nClosed from 5 June 2023. It reopens on the 10th of October 2023.\nThis is the address: Calle Fernando Madroñal, 2, 03007, Spain . And this is the address in Google Maps. Check the schedule on the pool’s website .\nWhat Can You Do in the Public Swimming Pools?\nThe swimming pools in Alicante offer courses designed for children, adults/teenagers and retired people. You can choose to go there and swim free by yourself or join one of the classes. If finally, you decide to join a course, the only restriction is that you have to join in advance for a full quarter. Let’s go to see how it works.\nSwimming Freestyle by Yourself\nThis is the easiest way to go to the pool. You just need to show up with a kind of ID: driving license, passport, NIE… and pay the entrance fee. There is a possibility to buy several entrances at the same time to save some money. A bit more information in this article.\nJoining a Class for a Quarter\nDuring the year, they do several courses targeting different people. The public can be children learning to swim, adults improving their swimming abilities or retired people keeping their bodies in shape by doing water aerobics . An important note to this is that you must be on the census in Alicante to be able to subscribe to these services. Here is all the information (in Spanish).\nPublic Swimming Pools Prices in Alicante\nThe prices are a bit difficult to find and you will need to have a good level of Spanish. They are inside a .pdf file on this page. If you registered on the census you might be able to get a 50% discount if you are younger than 26 or older than 63. Other scenarios where you will get a discount are: having a disability, being referred by a doctor and a few more. You will need to read the document or ask in the comments below to know more. In the pool, they will make you a member’s card if you are going to buy any of the bundles. Here is a table with the prices:\nTicket Type Price Discounted Price One entrance 3.70€ 1.85€ 10 entrances 28.10€ 14.05€ 20 entrances 44.35€ 22.18€ 30 entrances 59.05€ 29.53€ Public Swimming Pools Prices\nNote that you must use all your entrances in less than 9 months or you will miss them. You can pay in cash. If using the card, you need to use the website from your phone. They will give information on how to do it at the counter.\nI hope this article has helped you to decide if use or not public swimming pools in Alicante.

The European Union recommends train station connections to airports with more than 6 million passengers (in Spanish) . Nevertheless, Alicante Airport has no train station.\nIt has been repeated through the years by Spanish politicians that the station will be done. The 2008 crisis delayed for years the project. Local, regional and national politics haven’t helped either as no government has taken the project seriously.\nAnother reason the train station project has been blocked is that there is a medium-distance train going to Murcia whose tracks pass 1.5 mi (2.5km) away from the terminal. That train line is expected to be moved away from where it is now, right next to the sea for several miles. This project being stuck -as well- was delayed even more by the Alicante Airport’s train.\nAlicante Airport to Benidorm\nThere are 3 main ways to get to Benidorm from Alicante Airport: by TRAM Train, by bus and by car/taxi/transfer.

Transfers are not available when using a single trip ticket bought by cash or card.\nAfter 60 minutes, another trip will be charged.\nTips and Recommendations on How to Use the Bus Network In Alicante\nThe bus network in Alicante reaches most corners of the city. Virtually all bus lines have the start/end or drive-through Avenida Maisonave or Avenida Oscar Espla, nearby Alicante Train Station , Luceros, and/or the Rambla. This makes the network very centralised. It is very easy to go to the city centre but difficult to travel between neighbourhoods.\nAlso, the frequency of some of the lines is not the best, having to wait for the bus anytime from less than 10 minutes for the quickest lines to +1h for the slowest.\nSometimes, it is difficult to understand what line or lines you should be taking for moving from point A to point B so my recommendation is to use different apps to identify the best route.\nUse Google Maps to Understand What Lines to Use\nIronically, Google Maps have the best interface to understand what bus line or lines you should be taking.\nWhen clicking the layers button you can choose Maps to show all the public transport stops. This option will show you all the bus stops, the bus lines stopping at that particular bus stop and the bus line route. Note that all this info might be outdated at times.\nDespite this nice interface, your best option is just to write your destination and let it create the route by public transport for you.\nBut -and this is very important- the time the bus is stopping at each stop is not synchronized live between Google Maps and Vectalia (the bus company in Alicante) . This means that the time that Google Maps says it will take you to reach your destination is just a best guess and probably very wrong. Remember some bus lines’ frequency is higher than 1h.\nUse The Offical Bus App to Know When the Next Bus Is Coming\nAnd here is another App to save you time. Vectalia (Alicante’s bus company) has an app only for Android and iOS called Alicante Bus where you can see all the line frequencies at each bus stop.\nThe interface is not as simple as Google Maps but after a couple of usages it should be okay, here is what you can do:\nRemember the bus stop name from Google Maps\nOpen Alicante Bus’ official App ( Android , iPhone ) and search for the bus line Maps tells you to get\nGuess the bus direction the bus is going to\nAnd from the map in the Alicante Bus app search for the stop, Google Maps tells you to use\nI understand this is not an easy task and there is already a project to improve the digitalization of the bus service in Alicante and also add more lines to make it more usable. More about that in this press note in Spanish.\nQR Code at Bus Stop In Alicante\nAnother option is to go to the bus stop itself and point your phone camera at the QR code in the stop’s info post. It will redirect you to a page that tells you all the next buses coming to that stop.\nRoutes\nThe Alicante Bus network is thick. Anywhere you are in the city there is a nearby bus stop.\nThere are more than 30 lines to cover the city and its neighbouring cities.\nLines in Alicante Bus Network\nThere are tricks to know what bus you should get like using Google Maps and the Alicante Bus official app for Android or iOS .\nNight Buses\nThere are a few night bus services in Alicante. The lines with night services are:\n03N: Ciudad de Asis-Villafranqueza\n22N: Puerta del Mar – Cabo de Las Huertas – San Juan Beach\n21N: Puerta del Mar – San Juan – Campello\n23N: Plaza del Mar – San Juan – Muchamiel\n24N: Plaza del Mar – Universidad – San Vicente\nC-6: Alicante – Alicante Airport\nThe Buses\nAll buses are reasonably new and have AC or hitting on all year around.\nRed Bus In Alicante\nThe indoors are comfortable and have USB power plugs to charge electronic devices.\nIndoors of a Bus In Alicante\nAlicante TRAM Schedules and Timetables\nAlicante also has TRAM services that are underground in the city centre. Some places the TRAM can get you are San Vicente, Campello and Benidorm.

The companies operating the service -or starting soon- are Renfe , Iryo (from June 2023 ), Ouigo (starting May 2023) and Avlo (starting 27th March 2023) . There are usually more than 10 high-speed train services per day to Madrid.\nHow to buy tickets, estimated prices, times and more are in this article about the Train Station in Alicante.\nBut there are also other types of services running on the route: Alvia and Media Distancia.\nMedia Distancia\nThis is the slowest way to get to Madrid by train but, sometimes, it can be the cheapest. Media Distancia stands for medium distance. Those are the trains on trips of a few hundred miles between nearby cities in slow trains. You would need to do a transfer so you will have to take two trains for the Alicante-Madrid trip. Even if it happens to be the cheapest option by train on the date you need to travel it might not be the most comfortable one. You might want to use the bus if your priority is saving money. The prices are around 40€ but are worth checking on Renfe’s website.\nAlvia\nThis is the second-fastest train. It takes 2:45h to complete the route . It is a perfect option if the train times and prices match your expectations. The prices will wildly vary depending on Renfe’s prices algorithm. Sometimes can be less than 30€ and sometimes it can be more than 80€.\nAlvia trains have an optional fee for travelling in first class. All passengers can use the cafeteria coach where you can buy some food and snacks. The trains are adapted for passengers with reduced mobility. The Alvia trains can reach a speed of 155mph (250km/h) .\nHigh-Speed Trains\nThere are several companies offering high-speed trains to Madrid: Renfe , Iryo (from June 2023 ), Ouigo (starting May 2023) and Avlo (starting 27th March 2023) .\nRenfe AVE\nThis is the fastest train for the route between Alicante and Madrid. It can take as little as 2h to travel the distance but the time can vary on the service’s stops and train traffic. AVE stands for Alta Velocidad Española or Spanish High Speed. Trains can reach speeds of 193mph (310km/h).\nTwo AVE trains at Alicante’s Train Station Platform\nAVE trains have business class, and a cafeteria and are adapted for passengers with reduced mobility . AVE trains are the most frequent type of service during the day. Prices will vary highly on the route demand with Renfe’s prices algorithm. The way it works is similar to prices in flights. Sometimes, a ticket will be less than 30€ but sometimes it can escalate to more than 100€.\nAlicante to Madrid by Coach\nSeveral companies operate the route Alicante-Madrid. All buses will start at Alicante Coach Station and finish the route at Madrid Bus Station Estación del Sur (South Station) where you can take the Metro or local trains.\nThe main company operating the route is ALSA . You can check and buy the tickets on their website . Prices can start at 12.85€ or less. Again the price depends on demand and ALSA’s price algorithm.\nThe buses feature comfortable seats. They have two places for luggage: the boot for big bags/suitcases and the space above the seat for hand luggage.\nThe buses have a toilet and they do one mandatory stop in a service area halfway. The stop is near the town of La Junquera and you can buy traditional food and desserts from Albacete province .\nALSA usually show two movies with Spanish subtitles that you can listen to using headphones.\nAlicante to Madrid by Car\nThe motorway from Alicante to Madrid is free . Alicante’s elevation is 0m but Madrid’s elevation is 667m. Some parts of the motorway near Madrid might be a bit steep and curvy as it is a kind of old mountain motorway. You might find some traffic depending on the dates and times you are driving.\nIn general, the motorways are well maintained in Spain and have nice wide shoulders. The trip should take around 5 hours to take a break. If you are driving an electric car you can use the app ElectroMaps to plan where to stop and charge. The charging network is expanding fast in Spain. Right now you should be able to use one of the few fast chargers available on the route. Very shortly, more chargers will be added giving you some more options. There are Superchargers in the middle of the route if you drive a Tesla car.\nIt is well signposted how to go to Madrid from Alicante. The main motorway you will be driving on is called A-31.\nTravel from Alicante to Madrid using BlaBlaCar\nBlaBlaCar is a company for sharing car rides between particular people. It is popular in several European countries including Spain.\nIf you are a passenger, you will divide with the driver the petrol price. The prices for this ride start at 20€. The app has a booking and messaging system where you can speak with the driver. You can use that in-app chat to decide with the driver where to be picked up and left.\nAlicante to Madrid by Plane\nThe last option to travel from Alicante to Madrid is taking a flight.

    "content_text": "Alicante TRAM is a rail service that connects Alicante city centre with San Juan Beach and neighbouring towns such as El Campello, Benidorm and Denia.\nAlicante-Luceros Tram Station\nThe TRAM service operates in underground tunnels in Alicante city centre and overground in the rest of the line. There are 6 TRAM lines split into 3 zones . Prices vary from 1.45€ single ticket for one zone to 3,90€ for single tickets for the 3 zones and the equivalent of 0,76€ to 1.90€ when using the most affordable travel cards . Night services are available on summer weekends at the same price. Frequencies vary per line.\nAlicante’s TRAM service is reliable but can be slower than the car on some routes. The service inherits the old “Trenet” rails tracks and the updates from the old network focused on electrification and safety but not speed. Let’s see all you need to use this service, including pricing, routes and schedules.\nContents\nToggle\nHow to Pay for The TRAM\nAlicante’s TRAM has a mixture of fenced underground and unfenced overground stations.\nAt the underground stations, the tickets must be paid in advance on the machines around the stations and validated at the fence. A travel card is also valid.\nTRAM Payments Machine\nAt overground stations, the payment must be done inside the TRAM train . This is a bit counterintuitive, as the stations don’t have any payment machines available. The payment is done inside the train. The travel cards are also validated on the train.\nAll payment machines allow for: card payment, cash payment, and travel card recharge.\nRoutes\nThe TRAM train in Alicante has 6 lines:\nTRAM Line Origin Destination Max Single Ticket Fare L1 Alicante Center Luceros Benidorm Intermodal 2,80€ (2 zones) L2 Alicante Center Luceros San Vicente Del Raspeig 1,45€ (1 zone) L3 Alicante Center Luceros El Campello 1,45€ (1 zone) L4 Alicante Center Luceros Plaza La Coruña (San Juan) 1,45€ (1 zone) L5 Alicante Center Postiguet\n/Puerta del Mar Plaza La Coruña (San Juan) 1,45€ (1 zone) L9 Benidorm Denia 2,80€ (2 zones) Alicante TRAM Routes and Max Fares\nIn many of those stations, you can transfer from one line to the other if needed. All trains (except for line L5) stop at Luceros, Mercado and MARQ-Castillo.\nThere are 3 TRAM zones: A, B and C. And 2 special subzones: T1 and T2, serve as small zones in nearby stops located between the main zones. One zone fare is 1.45€, moving between two zones is 2,80€ and moving 3 zones is 3,90€. More details on prices and fares are down in this article, including return tickets and travel cards.\nTRAM Alicante Zones Map\nClick here to download the full-resolution Alicante’s Zone Map.\nHere is a list of the main routes and the time it takes to complete the trip:\nRoute Line(s) Zones Fare Time to Complete Alicante – Benidorm 1 A to B 2,80€ ~72 min Alicante – San Juan Beach 1, 4 or 5 A 1.75€ ~18 min Alicante – Calpe 1 and 9 A to C 3,90€ ~123 min Alicante – Altea 1 and 9 A to C 3,90€ ~101 min Alicante- Campello 1 or 3 A 1.75€ ~26 min Alicante – San Vicente 2 A 1.75€ ~28 min Alicante TRAM main routes: prices, lines and time\nFares\nThe single ticket price for one zone, such as Alicante-San Juan or Campello, is 1.45€ and the return ticket costs 2,50€.\nIf you move between 2 zones the price is 2,80€ and 4,80€ for the return ticket.\nMoving the 3 zones cost 3,90€ and the fare for the return ticket is 6,65€.\nIf you are going to use the tram often it might be worth getting a travel card pass; which is a rechargeable travel card that costs 2€.\nThe fares go down by more than 45% by paying with a travel card bonus. The same travel card pass can be used by more than one person on the same trip.\nTemporary Discounts on Travel Card Bonus\nFrom the 1st of February 2023 to the 31 of July 2024 there is a 50% discount on some of the travel cards.\nThis is due to a money injection in public transport the central government is undertaking through autonomics and local governments in order to keep the inflation rate lower.\nThe discounts are for the TRAM trains and MIA buses .\nNote that the single trip fare remains at 1.45€.\nThe prices and fares for the travel card pass vary on the number of bought trips:\n10 trips cost 4€ (normal price 8.00€) in between the same zone (0.40€ per trip, normal price 0.80€ per trip), 6€ (normal price 12,00€) in moving 2 zones (0.60€ per trip, normal price 1.20€ per trip) and 10€ per trip (normal price 20,00€) when moving 3 zones (1€ per trip, normal price 2€ per trip). A 24h for unlimited travelling in all zones is 8€.\nTRAM Train Arriving at the Fabrequer station\n30 trips cost 11.40€ (normal price 22.80€) (0.38€, normal price 0,76€ per trip), 17.10€ (normal price 34,20€) when moving 2 zones (0.57€, normal price 1,14€ per trip) and 3 zones commuting is 28.50€ (normal price 57,00€) (0.95€ per trip, normal price 1.90€ per trip).\nRemember: The same bonus ticket can be used by several people on the same trip.\nThere is also a 24-hour ticket that can be used for as many trips and as many zones as wished during the activation day. It cost 4€ while bonified (8€ normal price).\nThe travel cards are different for each TRAM Zone and only allow trips in between the zone it is assigned to. As an example, if you have a 1 zone travel card but want to go from Alicante to Benidorm you will need to buy a ticket at the start of your journey in Alicante. Alternatively, a card can be recharged with trips valid for travelling in between zones.\nTravel cards can be used only in the TRAM zone they have been habilitated for. Travel Card Mobilis bought for Tram Zone A can be used also in Alicante’s city buses .\nHere is the fares summary table:\nTicket Type Moving Between 1 Zone Moving Between 2 Zone s Moving Between 3 Zone Single 1.45€ 2,80€ 3,90€ Single return 2,50€ 4,80€ 6,65€ 10 trips travel card 4€ (0.40€ per trip), normal price 8,00€ (0.8€ per trip) 6€ (0.6€ per trip), normal price 12,00€ (1.2€ per trip) 10€ (1.00€ per trip), normal price 20,00€ (2€ per trip) 30 trips travel card 11.40€ (0.38€ per trip), normal price 22,80€ (0.76€ per trip) 17.10€ (0.57€ per trip), normal price 34,20€ (1.14€ per trip) 28.50€ (0.95€ per trip) normal price, 57,00€ (1.90€ per trip) 24h unlimited 4€/day (8€ normal price) 4€/day (8€ normal price) 4€/day (8€ normal price) Tram Alicante Fares\nFree for Those Under 30\nAnother discount the government has kicked off is for those under 30 not to pay at all for the TRAM service in Alicante. The 100% discount is active from the 9th of October until the 30 of June 2024.\nTo qualify you just need to be under 30 years old and get a temporary carton travel card that will be attached to your Spanish ID card (DNI), your resident ID card (NIE) or your passport. To apply:\nEnter Tram De Alicante website . Inside the Bulletin Board, press “ Free Jove season ticket – Request an appointment by clicking on this link \u003e\u003e\u003e “. You should be redirected to this page.\nBook an appointment to pick up your card in one of the TRAM De Alicante stations.\nPick up the travel card and validate it every time you use the bus or TRAM.\nNOTE: If you don’t have a Spanish DNI or NIE follow the instructions in this link. Essentially, you need help from someone with a DNI or NIE to book the appointment for you. Then, at the time you have the appointment, borrow her/his ID card. Showing your friends’ ID and your passport you will be able to pick up your free travel card.\nEven though the process to get the free travel card is done using the TRAM website and offices in the stations the discount is valid for the bus services too.\nAlso, remind you that, to qualify, you don’t need to be a resident, be empadronado or live in Alicante. Just be 30 or less and have a valid ID card/passport.\nSpecial Zones T1 and T2\nThere are a couple of special zones called T1 and T2 that are situated where the TRAM zones switch. So T1 is in between Zone A and Zone B. T2 is between Zone B and Zone C. When travelling inside the special zones the tram ticket to pay is just for 1 zone.\nAs an example, a traveller from Calpe to Altea would typically have to pay for a two-zone ticket (C to A). But both TRAM stops are inside the special zone T2. That means travellers from Calpe to Altea would need to pay a ticket fare equivalent to just one TRAM zone.\nOther Travel Cards Discounts\nThere are also travel cards for young and senior people. Talk to the staff at Luceros station about how to get it and to know if you qualify.\nHow to Buy a Travel Pass Card\nTo buy a Travel Card in Alicante city you can go to Luceros Station or any kiosk in Alicante as the same travel card works on Alicante’s busses and TRAM Zone A. At Lucreros, there is a counter with TRAM’s staff that will facilitate you with the proper travel card for your typical journeys and the first travel pass with 10 or 30 trips.\nMobilis Travel Card in Alicante for bus and TRAM\nOnce you have a travel card, it can be recharged on the machines at Luceros and Mercado or inside the TRAM trains. The card can be also used on the bus network at the same price.\nOther gated stations in the TRAM network such as Benidorm or Campello also sell travel cards.\nTRAM Zones and Travel Card Differences\nTram travel cards or bonuses can be used only in the TRAM zone they are assigned to. For example, if you bought a travel card in Alicante it can be used only in Tram zone A – Alicante Luceros to Poble Espanyol and other TRAM lines- and Alicante’s busses. If you bought the Mobilis travel card in Benidorm, it can be used only in zone B -from Amerador to Olla Altea in the north.\nIf you have a travel card bought in Alicante but want to travel to Benidorm you will need to buy a new ticket in the machine for the trip from zone A to zone B.\nAlternatively, in the case you travel between Zone A and Zone B often, you can talk to a member of the staff at the counter in the tram-gated stations to assign the travel card to be valid for trips between two zones. This way you can use your travel card to travel from -as an example- Alicante to Benidorm.\nKeep in mind, that if you assign two zones to your travel card every trip, even if it is inside one single zone, will be charged at the higher fee of two zones.\nEqually, if you want to use your travel card for the special zones T1 or T2 you need a member of the staff to assign your travel bonus trips to be used only in the special zones.\nHow to use the Travel Cards Mobilis\n1. The travel cards must be always tapped in at the start of your journey at either:\nThe gate at gatted TRAM stations -that are underground in Alicante and overground in the rest of the network-\nInside the TRAM train at the rest of the stations\nIt is important to always tap in as ticket inspectors randomly board the train.\n2. The travel card must be only tapped out if you are getting off at a gated station . The automatic gate would check the trip has been previously validated and open the door for the traveller.\nSeveral People Can Use the Same Travel Card\nNote that the same travel card can be used by several people on the same journey. Just tap in the same travel card as many times as people are travelling.\nFamily Getting Off the TRAM Train in Alicante. DALL-E AI Artwork\nIn case of need to get off in a gated station just pass the travel card at the gate once per person travelling.\nBe Aware of the Trips of your Travel Card Or Recharge Trips\nTo see the trips available or recharge your Mobilis TRAM bonus you can:\nAsk a member of the staff at any station counter to do it for you\nUse any ticket machine at stations or inside the TRAM trains\nUse Alicante’s TRAM App for Android or for iPhones\nAsk at kiosks in Alicante’s city for Zone A travel cards\nUse the Same Travel Cards at Alicante Bus Service\nAlicante TRAM travel cards for Zone A are valid for the bus service in Alicante . So, the travel cards bought in a kiosk or the TAM office can be used in the TRAM trains for zone A and vice-versa. The price per single trip and the travel card fees remain the same in both TRAMs and buses.\nThe official name for the TRAM trains is TRAM d’Alacant or TRAM de Alicante . Likewise, the name of the bus service is MIA, Movilidad Inteligente de Alicante , or Smart Mobility of Alicante.\nTransfer between buses is free if done within 60 minutes from the first touch with the travel card. Sadly, transfers do not apply to TRAM services and changing from a TRAM train to a bus will just void another trip in your travel card.\nNote that transfers with a single trip ticket are not available either in TRAMs or bus services.\nThe TRAM Trains\nMost of the TRAM line is electric. The trains are modern and quiet. All trains have cooling A/C on in summer and heating in winter.\nThere are no toilets on the trains or stations, so have this in mind when planning a long trip.\nThe Inside of a TRAM Train\nNote the TRAM has buttons inside the trains to ask the driver to stop at the next TRAM stop. This is especially important at slack times as any passenger might have pressed the stop button for the TRAM stop you would like to get off. It behaves in a similar way to what a bus would do.\nTravelling With Bicycles, Scooters or Pets\nTravelling with bicycles and scooters on the TRAM trains is permitted, even if your bicycle is not a folding bicycle.\nIf your bicycle is not folding you must stay standing while holding it.\nIf your bicycle or scooter is folding you must keep it folded and under your seat.\nThe TRAM services remind customers not to cause any damage to other passengers or the stations and trains with the vehicles.\nSadly, it is not permitted to travel with big pets such as dogs.\nThe exceptions are small pets in cages, recognised guide dogs and police dogs which are permitted.\nAlicante TRAM Schedules and Timetables\nThe TRAM in Alicante follows this schedule or timetable.\nLine 1 and Line 3 Alicante-Benidorm and Alicante-Campello Schedule\nLines 1 and 3 share some of the same stops until Campello so the schedule is offered together ( Click here to download full resolution schedule ).\nAlicante to Benidorm and Campello Schedule\nLine 1 and Line 3 Benidorm-Alicante and Campello-Alicante Schedule\n( Click here to download the full-resolution schedule ).\nBenidorm and Campello to Alicante Schedule\nLine L2 Alicante to San Vicente Schedule\n( Click here to download the full-resolution schedule )\nAlicante to San Vicente Schedule\nLine 2 San Vicente to Alicante Schedule\n( Click here to download the full-resolution schedule )\nSan Vicente to Alicante Schedule\nLine 4 Luceros – Plaza la Coruña Schedule\n( Click here to download the full-resolution schedule )\nLine 4 Luceros – Plaza la Coruña Schedule\nLine 4 Plaza la Coruña – Luceros Schedule\n( Click here to download the full-resolution schedule )\nLine 4 Plaza la Coruña – Luceros Schedule\nLine 5 Alicante Puerta del Mar (Postiguet) – Plaza la Coruña Schedule\n( Click here to download the full-resolution schedule )\nLine 5 Alicante Puerta del Mar (Postiguet) – Plaza la Coruña Schedule\nLine 5 Plaza la Coruña – Alicante Puerta del Mar (Postiguet) Schedule\n( Click here to download the full-resolution schedule )\nLine 5 Plaza la Coruña – Alicante Puerta del Mar (Postiguet) Schedule\nLines 1 and 9: Luceros to Denia Schedule\n( Click here to download the full-resolution schedule )\nTram L1 and L9 Luceros to Denia\nLines 1 and 9: Denia to Luceros Schedule\n( Click here to download the full-resolution schedule )\nTram L1 and L9 Denia to Luceros\nNigh TRAM Service: El Tramnochador\nTRAMNOCHADOR is in operation on July and August Fridays and Saturdays (summer 2024)\nEvery year the TRAM has night service at weekends.

    "content_text": "Uber Is Not Available in Alicante\nUber is an app to call taxi-like cars that will drive you to your destination. It is available in many cities around the world and they offer set prices for the rides, customer support and GPS car location tracking from the app among other advantages.\nDoes Alicante have Uber? Uber does not operate in Alicante. The company has announced the start of its ride operations several times but always got postponed. The only Uber-branded service in Alicante is Uber Eats which is available in cities such as Alicante or Elche but not in Benidorm or Javea .\nDespite Uber not being available in Alicante other alternative apps are offering similar services to Uber. Let’s going to find out what they are.\nContent:\nFree Now App\nCabify App\nPidetaxi App\nAlicante Airport Tranfers\nAre Cabify and Other Apps Legal In Alicante?\nHistory of Uber in Alicante\nUber Eats\nContents\nToggle\nAlternative Apps to Uber in Alicante\nUber does not operate in Alicante but there are other good ride app services operating in the city.\nThe first alternative is Cabify. It is a direct competition with Uber in many cities around the world. They are more centred in Spain and Latin-American countries than Uber. Cabify has been operating in Alicante for a few years.\nThe second alternative is PideTaxi. It is an app and website created by the traditional taxi drivers association in Spain and has similar features to Uber and Cabify plus a website.\nAlternative To Uber in Alicante: FREE NOW\nFREE NOW is a European Uber-like app founded in Hamburg, Germany. It operates in several European cities, including Alicante .\nDepending on the city they have different services available (taxis, bikes, etc), in Alicante, you can order two services: Taxi and Lite.\nFREE NOW App In Alicante\nOrdering a taxi you get a range of prices the ride will cost you. On the other hand, ordering the service “Lite” has a maximum set price.\nOn Taxi services, you can pay by cash (in Euros), by card in the Taxi or using the App. The Lite service allows only payments through the FREE NOW app.\nFREE NOW has an app for Android (click to download) and an App for iPhones (click to download) .\nHere are some common rides and their prices:\nOrigin Destination Price in € (Taxi/Lite) Alicante Renfe Train Station Alicante Airport 17-27/19.55 Alicante Luceros San Juan Beach 15-18/16.92 Alicante Airport Benidorm Not Available Alicante Renfe Train Station Calpe 82-100/90.53 Alicante Rambla MARQ Museum 7-8/7.78 Alicante Renfe Train Station Santa Barbara Castle 8-10/9.67 Alicante Luceros Universidad de Alicante 10-13/12.01 FREE NOW Prices on Common rides\nAlternative To Uber in Alicante: Cabify\nCabify is an app that you can install on your Android or iPhone device to book transport services by car. The service payment will be done automatically in-app by debit/credit card (including American Express and Diners Club) or PayPal.\nThe Uber-like service Cabify in Alicante also allows booking a traditional white taxi with a fixed price from the app.\nOnce registered in the app you can book a car for now or book it for a different time. Cabify offer different services in Alicante but they change over time:\nCabify: traditional 5-seater from Cabify vehicle to get you to your destination\nASAP: traditional 5-seater vehicle from either Cabify or traditional white Taxi, whichever is available first\nTaxi Fixed Price: Get a traditional cab instead of a Cabify branded car with a fixed price for the service\nCar Delivery: move your shipments in the trunk of the vehicle without you having to travel\nKids: 5-seater cars with adapted seats for children.\nCabify Corp: Higher-end corporate vehicles\nCabify Services in Alicante\nThe app gives you an estimate of the price of your ride before booking the car. Prices will change at peak/off-peak times but here are some guide fees:\nOrigin Destination Price Alicante Airport Alicante Renfe ~25€ Alicante Airport Benidorm ~90€ Alicante San Juan Beach ~35€ Alicante Calpe ~107€ Common journeys fees for Cabify (approximate)\nHere is the complete list of Cabify’s services and fares.\nHint: Traditional taxis are usually cheaper than Cabify in Alicante.\nHint 2: Some people report issues activating Cabify with no Spanish numbers. If this is your case, use PideTaxi for now and get a Spanish number if you are staying longer.\nIt Is Also Possible to Book a Cabify. Here Are the Fares\nPlace of Booking Extra Fee Alicante 15€ Pueblos Alicantinos 30€ Alicante Airport 20€ San Juan Beach 20€ Extras Fees When Booking a Cabify in Advance\nAlternative To Uber in Alicante: Traditional Taxi Using PideTaxi App\nThe second option is to use the PideTaxi website or their app on Android or iPhone . The use of the app is very similar to Uber and Cabify. After installing the app you can book and pay for cabs from your phone, get an estimated price of the ride and schedule a pick-up at a different time or day.\nPideTaxi App\nThe payment method in the PideTaxi app is card or cash. The fare will be deducted automatically from your credit or debit card if you choose the app option.\nIf you decide to pay by cash the driver will accept the money from you. Remember Spain uses Euros. Also know that, by law, all cabs must allow card payments.\nIf you are planning to go from Alicante or Alicante Airport to Benidorm here is a complete guide on prices and options.\nPrices are government-regulated, here is a list of guide prices for common destinations:\nOrigin Destination Price Alicante Renfe Alicante Airport ~22€ Alicante Renfe Benidorm ~67€ Alicante Renfe San Juan Beach ~19€ Alicante Renfe Calpe ~97€ Common Taxi journeys fees (approximate)\n* The cabs in Alicante Airport can be booked using Radio Taxi Elche or PideTaxi apps. Note taxis are organised in different associations depending on the city where they operate. Alicante Airport is in Elche’s municipality so taxis starting a ride from the airport are from the company Radio Taxi Elche instead of Radio Tele Taxi Alicante .\nThe airport has usually many taxis waiting for clients so it should be easy to get one. All the rides starting at the airport have an extra charge of 4.25€. More info on Alicante Airport Aena’s website . If you still want to use an app from Alicante Airport you can use Radio Taxi Elche or PideTaxi apps. Both apps’ usage is very similar the features are the same.\nPideTaxi is also available in the city of Benidorm. Here is how to go from Alicante and Alicante airport to Benidorm; including taxi, Cabify, TRAM train and more.\nAlicante Aiport Transfers\nSadly, the apps are not the best option to transfer from Alicante Airport. For example, Cabify allows you to select a pickup point at Alicante airport but does not allow you to confirm the booking.\nThe best option for transfer to Alicante’s city centre from the Airport is to use the 24/7 Alicante Aiport C6 Bus or get a taxi from the departures floor.\nIf your transfer is longer, for example, Alicante Aiport to Benidorm, you can book a taxi using the taxis website or using a transfer service such as the following for around 80€:\nThe cab driver will wait for you at the arrival doors at the airport with your name written on a little board for easy recognition. The service can be booked with a driver speaking Spanish or English.\nAre Cabify And Other Apps Legal in Alicante?\nYes, Cabify and other apps are legal in Alicante because they use legal company structures.\nCabify is a company that matches clients with drivers. In Alicante, cars are owned by a third-party company that hires drivers. This company owns what is called VTC licences. It stands for Vehículos de Turismo con Conductor or Tourist Vehicles with Driver.\nVTC’s are different from taxis in their regulation. For example, they can pick up people only if the service has been booked in advance. There are fewer VTC licences than taxi licences.\nTaxi drivers have been, traditionally, trying to beat Cabify, Uber and the VTC companies all around Spain. They have denounced the companies in the courts, created demonstrations so the government change the laws and launched advertising campaigns in the media to stop the apps.\nAfter seeing their efforts didn’t stop these taxi apps they have decided to work together with Cabify. The partnerships allow booking a traditional taxi service using the Cabify app with a fixed price.\nCabify Gives You Water and Plays The Music You Want to Listen to\nAs a way to differentiate from the competency, Cabify cars are usually clean and the colour is usually black. The driver will usually dress smart. They give you a small bottle of water and ask you what music you want to listen to before starting the trip.\nHistory of Uber in Alicante\nUber has been targeting Alicante for a long time. In February 2019 they were planning to offer UberX with VTCs, as Cabify is doing.\nThe taxi lobby in Catalonia started striking so the government changed a few laws that would make Uber illegal. Most of the regulations for the taxis and VTC are controlled by the Spanish autonomous communities and the head of Comunidad Valenciana announced some regulatory changes.\nAs Uber wasn’t still deployed in Alicante yet so they decided to postpone the launch of UberX. They were almost ready and they drew on Uber’s website the area of service in Alicante province and Costa Blanca.\nUber Eats\nUber Eats is a food delivery service that operates in Alicante. The app has a list of restaurants and dishes. You can select all the food you want from the app and pay for it.\nThe app Uber Eats will show you the status of your order, such as preparing food at the restaurant with an estimated time of arrival.\nWhen the courier is on the way you can see the exact location on the map. Some more information like his/her name, the car/motorbike/bike she/he is driving, the review stars other users gave to the driver and a button to make a call are available as well. At the end of the booking, you can make and leave a review as well.\nRelated Questions\nIs Cabify cheaper than a taxi?\nDepending on the route and peak/not peak time taxis can be cheaper than Cabify. It is a good idea to check both apps before taking your ride.\nIs the bottle of water in Cabify free?\nCabify doesn’t charge anything extra if you decide to drink or take your bottle of water.\nWill Uber be available in Alicante in the future?\nThe company has shown its intention of offering the rides service in Alicante several times. Chances are that they will offer the service when regulation settles.\nCan I book a white taxi using an app?\nYes. Cabify allows booking a white traditional taxi using their app and with a fixed price.\nPideTaxi allows booking a white traditional taxi at an open price."

    "content_text": "The train station is situated in the heart of Alicante. It connects the city with short, mid and long-distance trains, including AVE high speed to Madrid . Let’s go and find out more details.\nAlicante Train Station\nContents\nToggle\nWhere is Alicante Train Station?\nAlicante Train Station Location\nThe train station address is 1 Avenida Salamanca. 03005 Alicante . Click here for opening it on Google maps . It is situated in the centre of the city:\n30 min walk from the beach El Postiguet\n20 min walk from the nightlife area El Barrio\n5 min away from the commercial street Avenida de Maisonnave .\n5 min away from the Tram Train Station Alicante-Luceros\nMany buses have a stop very close to the station. The Tram underground station is a 5 min walk away, in Plaza de Los Luceros .\nTrain Station VS TRAM station in Alicante\nAlicante has also a rail service called TRAM. It is a mix of a slow TRAM train for moving around the city and a slightly faster train for longer journies to places such as Villajoyosa, Benidorm, Altea or Denia.\nThe TRAM Station is 6 min walk from the Train Station in Alicante\nSo, for example, if you need to go to Madrid , Barcelona or Valencia you need to use a long-distance Renfe or -from June 2023- Iryo train. If you need to go to Benidorm, Altea, Villajoyosa or Denia you have to use one of the TRAM stations such as the one in Luceros. As a curiosity, Alicante-Benidorm by TRAM train takes about 1 hour and 10 minutes and costs 2,80€ single with no travel card.\nAll the information needed about the TRAM in Alicante, such as destinations, fares, schedule, travel cards and recommendations is in the article this sentence links.\nWhere to Buy Train Tickets From Alicante?\nAll the short, medium and long-distance trains from/to Alicante are operated by Renfe at the moment. Iryo is selling online low-cost tickets for high-speed and long-distance to Albacete and Madrid trains scheduled for June 2023 and onwards. Ouigo is selling tickets from the 1st of March 2023 and the service starts on May 2023.\nThere are a few ways to buy train tickets from or to Alicante :\nYou can buy tickets for Renfe’s trains in Alicante at Renfe’s Official Website . This is for trains going to all destinations available from Alicante.\nAt Renfe’s office inside the railway station in Alicante, a teller can assist you with the purchase in a more traditional manner. Only for long-distance trains to destinations such as Madrid or Barcelona.\nThe third way to buy train tickets to or from Alicante’s train station is by using the few automatic machines around the train station . This is for trains going to all destinations available from Alicante.\nOn the Iryo’s website for High-Speed Trains to Albacete and Madrid only.\nOn Ouigo’s website for high-speed trains to Albacete and Madrid only.\nOn Avlo’s website for high-speed trains to Albacete and Madrid only.\nThere are also third-party comparison websites , such as The Trainline , that offer Renfe train tickets in a similar way they compare prices for airlines.\nHow to Buy a Ticket from the Office Inside the Station\nA funny contra intuitive situation is that buying a ticket in person is not so easy.\nThe Renfe’s office at the station has two different queues: one for trains that are leaving soon and another for the rest of the requests, including complaints and trains that are not immediately leaving.\nMachine to get the number for the queue for trains leaving in the next few hours and complaints\nTo add more confusion, the queues for buying the tickets for trains that are leaving in a few hours/days need to get queue number from the small machine at one of the entrances. The same is true for complaints or other requests.\nHowever, the queues for the trains that are leaving in the following minutes don’t have this electronic machine and you can just stand in line as you would wait for the teller at the bank or at the cashier in the supermarket.\nWhat Services Are at Alicante Train Station?\nInside and outside the train station there are a few services that can help you in your journey:\nRental Cars at Alicante’s Renfe-Adif Train Station\nMachines to buy short and long-distance train tickets\nA Renfe office where you can buy the train tickets or sort out any issue you might have with an agent\nFree public toilets\nVending machines\nFood restaurants\nCurrency exchange office\nTourist information office\nCar rental office\nCash machine\nSouvenir shops\nCar rental companies\nTaxi services\nOn the left exit at Alicante Terminal railway station (left when the trains are at your back), there is a taxi stop. There are usually taxis waiting for customers at any time trains operate.\nTaxis Waiting at Alicante’s Train Station\nWhere can I go from Alicante Railway Station?\nThe terminal offers services for medium and long-distance trips, including AVE high-speed trains.\nMurcia is a common commute for many Alicantinians and Murcians. There are two trains serving the route:\nAlicante to Murcia Short Distance train called Cercanias\nAlicante to Murcia Medium Distance Train called Media Distancia\nBoth trains stop at Elche but at different stations. Cercanias takes longer and has a few more extra stops than Media Distancia to Murcia. Prices go from 9.85€.\nHigh-speed AVE trains at Alicante’s train station platform\nAnother common route is the train from Alicante to Madrid . The cities are connected by the high-speed train called AVE which stands for Alta Velocidad Española or Spanish High Speed. Times average 2:30 hours for 260 mi (420km).\nValencia , Barcelona and other further cities are connected with our without transfer with slightly slower long-distance trains.\nHere is a list of a few of the direct trains from/to Alicante Train Station:\nDestination Type Of Train Time Madrid High Speed from 2h Valencia Long Distance 2h Barcelona Long Distance 5:20h Elche Regional/Mid Distance 33min/20min Murcia Regional/Mid Distance 1:30h/50min Santander Long Distance from 7h Ourense High Speed around 4:56 Zamora High Speed around 3:45 Leon High Speed around 4:52 Direct Trains from Alicante Train Station\nTrains from Alicante to Elche\nAlicante and Elche are two neighbourhood cities separated by just below 30km (18 mi).\nThere are two trains going to Elche from Alicante:\nCercanias Line C1\nThis is the most frequent, cheap and convenient train.\nIt takes between 30 and 31 minutes to go from Alicante to Elche and it stops in both Elche-Carrus and Elche-Parque .\nThe inconvenience of this line is the trains that are old. An early 80s diesel train (~40 years old!) that will make you enjoy if you are a train hobbyist but that smells a bit of diesel inside. Nevertheless, the trains have A/C and are well-maintained.\nNote that you cannot buy online these train tickets! Cercanias does not appear on the main searcher on Renfe’s website. To buy the tickets you need to either go to Renfe’s office and ask the teller or find the Cercanias machine close to the train gates.\n80’s train at Elche’s Station\nThe schedule for departures from Alicante on a weekday is as follows. Check Renfe’s Cercanias page for the return and weekend schedule:\nLine Departure Arrival Time of travel C1 05.45 06.15 0.30 C1 06.30 07.01 0.31 C1 07.30 08.04 0.34 C1 08.00 08.40 0.40 C1 09.10 09.40 0.30 C1 09.20 10.03 0.43 C1 10.50 11.21 0.31 C1 11.20 11.50 0.30 C1 12.30 13.00 0.30 C1 13.20 13.50 0.30 C1 14.10 14.40 0.30 C1 15.00 15.31 0.31 C1 15.50 16.20 0.30 C1 16.40 17.11 0.31 C1 17.30 18.00 0.30 C1 19.10 19.40 0.30 C1 20.00 20.30 0.30 C1 20.50 21.20 0.30 C1 22.30 23.00 0.30 Alicante-Elche Timetable On a Weekday\nLong Distance Trains Alicante-Elche AV (Alta Velocidad)\nIn just 20 minutes, trains using the high-speed network from Alicante to Murcia have a stop at Elche Av (Alta Velocidad or High Speed) station.\nThe trains are electric, faster and newer but there are fewer trains per day plus the Elche AV train station is 7km (~4 mi) away from the city centre.\nElche AV to Elche City Center\nYou can buy online these tickets on Renfe’s website choosing as your destination “Elche AV”.\nOther Services Alicante-Elche\nIt is possible to buy a ticket from Alicante to Elche Parque or Elcche Carrus through Renfe’s website.\nSome services have a similar price as the C1 line and others will be more expensive.\nNote the schedule you see from Renfe’s trains searcher is not the schedule for line C1. You will only see a very few services per day.\nAlso, note some services will take more time or be way more expensive than the C1 line. The only advantage is trains might be newer -so no diesel smell inside the carriages- but the C1 line might be more reliable, frequent and cheaper.\nGet to Alicante Train Station\nIf you live in the centre it is very easy to reach the station. Getting there on foot is probably the best way to get to the station if you live less than 20 minutes away. If you are not in the centre, you live, for example in San Vicente del Raspeig or Playa de San Juan, you can use public and private services to go to the train station. Your options are Tram, bus, taxi or Cabify.\nHow to Go to Alicante’s Train Station by Bus?\nThere are many bus lines stopping less than 5 minutes walk away from the station: 06 , C-6 , 22 , 21 , 04 , 03 , 04 , 07 and a few other lines will drop you up close enough.

All the Tram lines stop in Luceros as it is the first/last stop. You need to walk from Plaza de Los Luceros to the train station to reach the train station . It is only one street called Avenida de la Estacion . It is a walk of fewer than 5 minutes.\nHow to Get by Uber?\nUber is Not Available in Alicante\nSadly, Uber is not available in Alicante yet. Their website is confusing as the city is listed on one of their pages but the app won’t allow you to request the service and will show an error message: “Unfortunately, Uber is currently unavailable in your area.”\nIf you want a similar service you can use the taxi app PideTaxi. Read up in this Get a Taxy using the App PideTaxi .\nAnother option is to use the Spanish service called Cafiby .

To be accurate, no one remembers it. There are some images of snow in 1932 . That year was the last time it snowed and settled for a few hours. Never again since then.\nIf you want to find snow you can drive a few kilometres up in the mountain. Almost every year the snow will settle there for a couple of days or so, depending on the year.\nAs you can see, December might not be a month for going to the beach but is warmer than in many other cities in Spain and Europe. It is perfect for escaping the cold and dark winter.\nWhat To Wear\nWhat clothes to wear to a trip is always challenging. In December, Alicante is cold at night but warm at daytime.\nWear a mix of T-shirts and trousers for the mornings (approx 15°C to 20°C) and jumpers/coats/jackets for nights and early mornings (approx 3°C-5°C).\nIf you are brave and it is not windy, you might feel comfortable for a few hours on warmer days under the sun in shorts and T-shirts, or even on the beach in your swimming clothes.\nAlicante in Christmas\nIn 2023, the Christmas lights and decorations are inaugurated on Friday 16 of November.\nSome of the special decorations are the Christmas tree in Avenda de la Cosntitucion , a gigantic Bear in Plaza de la Montaneta and the Christmas lights in 114 streets around Alicante.

    "content_text": "The weather in November in Alicante is one of the factors we need to take into account if we want to visit or move to the city in that month. Fortunately, the weather in Alicante is privileged and November is a sunny month in the area. Let’s going to jump into more details.\nPhoto of Alicante’s urban beach in November\nContents\nToggle\nTemperature, it Gets Warm\nThe average temperature of November in Alicante is 20°C (68°F) in the maximum range and 10°C (50°F) in the minimum. But averages mean that you can get hotter days and colder days. It won’t be rare to enjoy a 25°C (77°F) in the middle of November if you are lucky. Alicante is warm in fall and winter.\nThis is how it looked at El Postiguet beach on the first Sunday of November 2022:\nLight Hours\nBut the temperature is not everything. The rainy season happens right after Summer is over and the Sun usually shines on the sky. Alicante’s weather in November gives an average of 10h of light per day and a whopping 5.8h of direct sun irradiation per day on average to its inhabitants and visitors. To get some context, in a great city like London, UK, November gives 9h of light and only 2.4h of sun irradiation per day in a way colder and wetter weather with a weaker sun as its northern latitude.\nThe Rain is not Really an Issue\nRain rarely occurs in November. It is still somehow in the high range of the year average with 3.8 days of rain on average. If it is going to rain, there are more chances that it happens in November than in July but chances are still super low. To have some more context, a great city like Manchester, UK, has 14.1 days of rain in November on average.\nHopefully, we have now a better idea of how is the weather in November in Alicante, Spain. If you have any other question that was not answered or you want to share how is the weather where you live and the weather in your dream city, please, use the comments system below.\nThe Weather In October, December and Other Months\nAlicante is a warm city all year round. It doesn’t rain much but if you are planning a trip towards the end of the year or Christmas, here is a detailed explanation of Alicante’s weather in October and here is a detailed explanation of Alicante’s weather in December .\nIf you are planning to visit Alicante during the coldest months of the year check this article about Alicante’s weather in autumn, winter and the beginning of Spring ."

    "content_text": "The climate should be always taken into account when going on holidays or moving to a new city. October is the first full month of fall and, as everywhere else, the Alicante weather in October is different from what it is during summer. But how is it different?\nAlicante’s twilight on a cloudy day\nContents\nToggle\nTemperature\nUsually, October is a very comfortable month thermally speaking. The summer is over and nights start to be chilled. The average minimum temperature gets down to 14.4°C (57.9°F) versus the 20.6°C (69.1°F) of August.\nThat means better sleep nights and no use of AC or fans. This is an important event in Alicante as nights can be sweltering in summer.\nDuring the day, it can still get warm as the maximum average temperature gets up to 24.5°C (76.1°F). The day/night average temperature is 19.4°C (66.9°F) and you will usually be soaked by the sun when you are outdoors. In general, Alicante’s autumn and winter are warm.\nSea Temperature and Beaches\nAs you can see, that can easily be day-on-the-beach weather. But what about going into the water? Well, if you are a bit brave you can. The average Mediterranean seawater temperature is 22.4°C (72.32°F) during October.\nView of La Albufereta Beach\nTo compare, in summer, the sea temperature on the central beach El Postiguet , can get up to 29°C (84.2°F) in summer but, during winter , it can go down all the way to 13°C (55.4°F). This means the sea is still warm in October in Alicante. Many people do enjoy the beach in October in Alicante.\nAs an example, here is a video from the Laboratorio de Meteorologia de la Universidad de Alicante , or Alicante University Meteorology Lab (On Facebook ). It dates from the 1st of October 2022:\nLight Hours\nIn October, you will have 7 hours of sun irradiation and 11h of light. To put it in context, Oslo enjoys 1h hour less light per day than Alicante in October.\nRain Could Show Off\nOctober is the month that historically rains the most in Alicante. Chances are still low but we need to understand that rain is different in other cities. In this part of Spain, it will rain a lot during a short period of time, 4.1 days on average. So when it rains it is usually cloudy for a few days but generally less than a week. The rain shows off intermittently but heavily during those days. When it starts raining the best is to be dry at home, a hotel or a shelter in a bar or restaurant. I wouldn’t say that this statistic is a deal-breaker and you probably should still organise your holidays for this month.\nHow to Enjoy Alicante in October\nAlicante is a lively city all year round.\nAlicante is a very Spanish city with lots of local people living all year round. Tourism goes down a bit in October compared to summer but there are always things to do, both culturally and partying style.\nFor example, you can visit some of the many museums in Alicante , visit Santa Barbara Castle , organise a sailing day off to Tabarca or join some Meet Ups happening in Alicante if you are a solo traveller wanting to meet more people.\nThe Weather In November and Other Months\nI hope this article helps you understand how is the weather in October in Alicante, Spain.\nWe have an article on how is Alicante Weather in November and what to do by clicking on this sentence.\nClick here for all the Alicante articles during the cold weather months.\nIf you still have any questions or you had experiences with the weather in Alicante during October, please, feel free to add a comment belo w ."

    "content_text": "Alicante excels as a beautiful destination for its picturesque landscape, the sea and the good weather all year around .\nA Clear Day In Alicante\nAutumns and winters in Alicante are mild and sunny. September to November are the months when it rains the most in Alicante. The rain is usually concentrated in just a few hours of heavy showers and it doesn’t stay cloudy for a lot of time, allowing the sun to shine most of the days. From November, the weather is more stable and dry. In the city of Alicante, it never snows .\nWeather – Tutiempo.net\nThe beach is used by many people up until the end of September or the beginning of October as the water is still hot and the sun can warm up still a lot. The coldest month is February with an average minimum temperature of 8.1°C but the sun shines an average of 8.8h a day in the sky. Alicante in autumn and winter is warm, sunny and energetic.\nContents\nToggle\nAverage Temperatures\nAverage Temperatures from October to February in Alicante. Data from Aemet.\nThe coldest month in Alicante is January , with a minimum average of 6°C (or 42.8°F) but a maximum average of 17°C (or 62.6°F) in the morning.\nFebruary is the second coldest month with a Celsius degree average warmer than January: 7°C (or 44.6°F) minimum and 18°C (or 64.4°F) maximum temperatures.\nThe weather in Alicante in October is still warm. The maximum average is 25°C (or 77°F) and the minimum of 15°C (or 59°F).\nIn November and December , average temperatures go down a bit to get us to the coldest month of the year (January as we have seen). The average minimums are 10°C (or 50°F) and 7°C (or 44.6°F). But the maximum temperatures are still comfortable: 21°C (or 69.8°F) and 18°C (or 64.4°F).\nSea Water Temperature\nAverage Sea Temperature from October to February in Alicante. Data from weather-atlas.com\nAlicante is a seaside city with more than 10 beaches reachable by walk or public transport .\nIn winter, Alicante beaches are still usable and it is possible to go for a swim if you are a bit brave.\nDuring the morning, maximum temperatures can get hot, with more than 25°C (or 77°F) on the thermometers and it will be usually sunny. The sea is at 22°C (or 71.6°F) on average during December. That’s still fine for a swim.\nSunshine Days\nAverage Sunshine Days from October to February in Alicante. Data from weather-atlas.com\nIronically, December, the month with shorter days -about 9.5h of the sun over the horizon- is the month with fewer cloudy days, having 26 days of sunshine per month.\nJanuary and February have 25 and 23 days of sunshine -remember February is only 28 or 29 days long- but the month with more cloudy days on average in October. With just 22 days of complete sunshine, it is also the month with the most rain in Alicante on average.\nRain\nAverage Rainy days from October to February in Alicante. Data from Aemet.\nWe say in the sunshine days section that the most cloudy day is October, with an average of 9 cloudy days. This makes October the wettest month in Alicante, with an average of 4.5 days of rain as per Aemet.\nNovember is still wet by Alicantinian standards with an average of 4.2 days. December averages 3.8 days of rain, January 3.6 and February is the dryest month of the Atum-Winter, with an average of just 3.0 days of rain.\nOnly June, July and August in the summer are dryer than February on average in Alicante.\nTorrential Rains and Flash Floods\nThe Mediterranean coast is known for its torrential flash floods and Alicante (also its province) is an area that is especially affected by this phenomenon.\nThe flash flood is known as Gota Fria , which translates to Gold Drop. The press is lately using more and more the technical term DANA – Depresión Aislada en Niveles Altos – which translates to Isolated Upper-Level Depression.\nAn incomplete explanation of this phenomenon is a small accumulation of cold air travelling the Atlantic to Europe diverts its course from the main accumulation. When it finds hot air from the Mediterranean Sea -in September the water is still very hot so it warms up the air plus adds a lot of humidity- heavy rains are sometimes formed. There is more on the Wikipedia page for Cold Drops. Alicante is especially affected by Gotas Frias or DANAs but is a general characteristic of Mediterranean weather.\nSome years, Alicante gets heavy -but manageable- rain for a few days. Or maybe nothing. But other years, Alicante gets torrential rain that can be dangerous for a couple of days or so.\nOne of the most remembered Gotas Frias happened in 1997 (in Spanish), having one of the records of rain in the city. After that event, a lot of money has been invested to prepare the city for heavy rains. Now Alicante can tolerate many litres of water per hour safely for the inhabitants.\nIs it Going to Rain Gota Fria when I Travel to Alicante?\nAnother characteristic of this type of rain is how difficult it is to predict where it is going to hit. Heavy rain is formed fast and locally and a city can be hit hard while another city, just 10km away, might not see a drop of rain.\nWeather services in Spain are very good at predicting the areas where Gota Fria can happen and when are the most dangerous hours. They raise climate alerts that can be yellow or red. Green is the colour for no alerts.\nThe press is also very good at informing of these meteorological events so they won’t go unnoticed even by tourists. If you want to check weather alerts in Spain go to the official Amet page at this link.\nPlease, always follow the official advice on heavy weather events as it can get very dangerous.\nThe Most Common Month for Gota Fria or DANA\nEven though October is the cloudiest month in Alicante, September is the wettest month in the city with an average of 56mm in September vs 47mm in October.\nSeptember is the month with most DANAs or Gotas Frias in Alicante on average so October is usually calmer and the eventual rain is lighter.\nSo you should not think that much about the rain, Cold Drops or DANAs when planning to travel to Alicante. Even if you are unlucky and get some rainy days, there are usually no more than 2 or 3 days in a row being cloudy or rainy. It is not a guarantee but the most common weather behaviour.\nHow Cold Can It Get in Alicante City?\nIn Alicante city it never snows , it has exactly 0 days of snow per year. The coldest month on average is January, with a minimum average of 6°C (or 42.8°F). The minimum temperature ever registered in Alicante was -4.6°C on the 12th of February 1956 as per Aemet. It is probably not going to happen again.\nSome days it can get to freezing temperatures at night. The average is 0.4 days in January so it is extremely uncommon -not impossible- to be at negative temperatures in Alicante city, not even common at night.\nHouses Insolation\nThe traditional Mediterranian architecture is designed to dissipate heat very efficiently. To achieve so, houses usually generate a lot of shadow with elements such as awnings and shutters that are found in virtually any house in Spain and, especially, in the Mediterranean.\nAs we have seen, it doesn’t get very cold in Alicante, with the coldest average of more than 6 degrees Celsius and a maximum of 17 in the morning. Traditionally, houses are not very well isolated for the winter. Also, old flats won’t usually have central heating or radiators.\nPeople in many European countries are used to setting the heating to be very warm at home, maybe even at +20°C at home.\nIn Alicante, people are -oftentimes- not used to heating the house at all, or maybe just using small electric heaters for the rooms needing heat.\nThere is also the concept of summer and winter pyjamas. People usually sleep with long sleeves and think pyjamas not be cold at night.\nNew buildings are better isolated and might count on heat via AC machines or radiators. If this is important for you, always check with the owners about the heating system before renting or buying a house in Alicante.\nCan you Swim in Winter in Alicante?\nThe sea temperature is very hot until October. It averages 17°C. The sun will usually shine in the sky and warm up the air up to 25°C on average.\nIf you are a bit brave you can enjoy swimming on Alicante beaches in autumn but the winter is when the waters get colder with a minimum of 14°C in February.\nDetailed Weather and What To Do by Month\nAlicante has mild winters but not all the cold months are the same.\nIf you want a detailed explanation of how is the weather in a particular month plus some clues on what is better to enjoy with that weather click on their respective detailed article:\nAlicante Weather and What to Do in October\nAlicante Weather and What to Do in November\nAlicante Weather and What to Do in December\nAlicante Weather and What to Do in January\nAlicante Weather and What to Do in February\nAlicante Weather and What to Do in March\nAlicante Weather and What to Do in April\nAlicante Weather and What to Do in May"
