# out/AGENTS

This folder stores generated data artifacts.

- Treat files here as build outputs; do not hand-edit.
- Regenerate via cmd/export or cmd/search when inputs change.
- Keep file names stable; downstream code uses default paths.
- If you change output formats, update internal/rag and README usage.
