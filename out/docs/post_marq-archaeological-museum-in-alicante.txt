MARQ Museum
The current MARQ museum uses an old hospital building dating from 1931 and was opened in 2000.
It has space for 6 main permanent displays, a couple of archaeological excavation replicas and temporary expositions.
The 6 permanent rooms are:
Prehistory
Entrance to the Prehistory exhibition at MARQ Alicante
This permanent room exhibits objects from the prehistory period, starting around 100,000 years ago to the VIII BC century. There are more than a thousand objects from different societies from back then: hunter-gatherers, farmers and herders and the early metallurgists.
The end of this period (VIII BC) is considered to have happened when the indigenous villages entered into contact with the Phoenicians which developed into the Iberian culture.
Iberians

MARQ Archaeological Sites
There are also a few archaeological sites that are part of the MARQ Museum. They are extremely important to understand the story of Alicante.
Tossal de Maminses – Lucentum
This is arguably the most important site in Alicante as it is considered the ancient city of Alicante.
Entrance Lucentum
It used to be a human settlement in the Iberian period. After a few centuries, the settlement mutated into a Roman city and it was called Lucentum .
The name Lucentum is well incorporated into the current Alicantinian culture. There is a basketball team with the name and a fair amount of businesses and brands with the name.
The ancient city is rounded by about 600 meters of defensive walls. It is nearby La Albufereta Beach 3.5km away from the current city centre of Alicante .
The first signs of occupation in Lucentum date from the 5th century BC but it was in the 3rd century BC when the defensive walls and towers were built shaping the later Roman city.
The second Punic War , around the year 200 BC, affected the city that was almost destroyed. It had to wait until the end of the II century BC to start a strong rebuild where the walls were reinforced, created new defensive towers and the overall defensive system was improved.
In the mid-1st century BC, Augusto was the emperor of the Roman Empire. Lucentum got the status of “municipium” which gave a few extra rights to the city in the empire’s structure such as the right of self-governance and some other Roman legal structures. At this point in history, the city received the name Lucentum .
Roman Baths in Lucentum Alicante
In the 1st century BC and the 1st century AD, the city grew into a traditional and prosperous Roman city. Typical buildings and structures were built: the forum, Roman baths, sewage system, and a temple… the city even grew and extended outside its original walls.
Sadly, at the end of the 1st century, AD Lucentum started its final decadence period and the citizens vanished in the III AD century due to economic and regional dynamics.
The city was used then as a stone quarry for nearby constructions for a long time. During the VIII and X AD centuries, the area was used by the Muslims as an Islamic cemetery.
The archaeological site was declared Monumento Histórico-Artístico or Monument of Historic and Artistic Importance in 1961.
How to Get to Lucentum
Lucentum is situated on Calle Zeus, 03016, Alicante .
The bus line to get to Lucentum is 09 and the stop is called Zeus 3.
The closest TRAM stop is Albufereta on lines 1, 3, 4 and 5.
La Illeta dels Banyets
This is an important archaeological site with remains dating from the prehistoric period.
Entrance to La Illeta dels Banyet
Back in the time, when the site was populated, it was a peninsula. In an unknown year, the peninsula was cut from the mainland due to an earthquake. In 1943, it was transformed into a peninsula again but not without polemic as some evidence of the remains was destroyed in the process.
The location is in the nearby town of El Campello , around 9km from Alicante’s city centre.
In this little peninsula, there are reminders of many cultures and epochs, starting from prehistory, we have reminders from the Bronze Age, Iberians, a Roman city and the Muslim occupation in the Middle Ages.
Remains Illeta dels Banyet
Another interesting remaining is from the Roman period. They built a little fish farm on the sea. With 4 ponds it has two channels to refresh the water from seawater. The ponds are communicated with vertical slots that could be closed using doors.
Fish Farm Remains Illeta dels Banyet
There are only remains of this type of fish farm in the province of Alicante and some areas in Italy.
If it is summer, there is another interesting activity to do in this place. The fish farm is free entrance and swimming is permitted.
If you wish to do some snorkelling there is a pretty route going around the little peninsula, including the fish farm.
