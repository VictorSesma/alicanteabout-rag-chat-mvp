* The cabs in Alicante Airport can be booked using Radio Taxi Elche or PideTaxi apps. Note taxis are organised in different associations depending on the city where they operate. Alicante Airport is in Elche’s municipality so taxis starting a ride from the airport are from the company Radio Taxi Elche instead of Radio Tele Taxi Alicante .
The airport has usually many taxis waiting for clients so it should be easy to get one. All the rides starting at the airport have an extra charge of 4.25€. More info on Alicante Airport Aena’s website . If you still want to use an app from Alicante Airport you can use Radio Taxi Elche or PideTaxi apps.

Alicante Aiport Transfers
Sadly, the apps are not the best option to transfer from Alicante Airport. For example, Cabify allows you to select a pickup point at Alicante airport but does not allow you to confirm the booking.
The best option for transfer to Alicante’s city centre from the Airport is to use the 24/7 Alicante Aiport C6 Bus or get a taxi from the departures floor.
If your transfer is longer, for example, Alicante Aiport to Benidorm, you can book a taxi using the taxis website or using a transfer service such as the following for around 80€:
The cab driver will wait for you at the arrival doors at the airport with your name written on a little board for easy recognition. The service can be booked with a driver speaking Spanish or English.
Are Cabify And Other Apps Legal in Alicante?
Yes, Cabify and other apps are legal in Alicante because they use legal company structures.
Cabify is a company that matches clients with drivers. In Alicante, cars are owned by a third-party company that hires drivers. This company owns what is called VTC licences. It stands for Vehículos de Turismo con Conductor or Tourist Vehicles with Driver.
VTC’s are different from taxis in their regulation. For example, they can pick up people only if the service has been booked in advance. There are fewer VTC licences than taxi licences.
Taxi drivers have been, traditionally, trying to beat Cabify, Uber and the VTC companies all around Spain. They have denounced the companies in the courts, created demonstrations so the government change the laws and launched advertising campaigns in the media to stop the apps.
After seeing their efforts didn’t stop these taxi apps they have decided to work together with Cabify. The partnerships allow booking a traditional taxi service using the Cabify app with a fixed price.
Cabify Gives You Water and Plays The Music You Want to Listen to
As a way to differentiate from the competency, Cabify cars are usually clean and the colour is usually black. The driver will usually dress smart. They give you a small bottle of water and ask you what music you want to listen to before starting the trip.
History of Uber in Alicante
Uber has been targeting Alicante for a long time. In February 2019 they were planning to offer UberX with VTCs, as Cabify is doing.
The taxi lobby in Catalonia started striking so the government changed a few laws that would make Uber illegal. Most of the regulations for the taxis and VTC are controlled by the Spanish autonomous communities and the head of Comunidad Valenciana announced some regulatory changes.
As Uber wasn’t still deployed in Alicante yet so they decided to postpone the launch of UberX. They were almost ready and they drew on Uber’s website the area of service in Alicante province and Costa Blanca.
Uber Eats
Uber Eats is a food delivery service that operates in Alicante. The app has a list of restaurants and dishes. You can select all the food you want from the app and pay for it.
The app Uber Eats will show you the status of your order, such as preparing food at the restaurant with an estimated time of arrival.
When the courier is on the way you can see the exact location on the map.
