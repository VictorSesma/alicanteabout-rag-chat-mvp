Light Hours
But the temperature is not everything. The rainy season happens right after Summer is over and the Sun usually shines on the sky. Alicante’s weather in November gives an average of 10h of light per day and a whopping 5.8h of direct sun irradiation per day on average to its inhabitants and visitors. To get some context, in a great city like London, UK, November gives 9h of light and only 2.4h of sun irradiation per day in a way colder and wetter weather with a weaker sun as its northern latitude.
The Rain is not Really an Issue
Rain rarely occurs in November. It is still somehow in the high range of the year average with 3.8 days of rain on average. If it is going to rain, there are more chances that it happens in November than in July but chances are still super low. To have some more context, a great city like Manchester, UK, has 14.1 days of rain in November on average.
