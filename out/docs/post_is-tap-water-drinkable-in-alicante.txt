Drinking-Water Flavour in Alicante
The flavour of the water can be very different from one city to another in Spain. Chances are that it will be very different from your country of origin. One of the reasons for this strong flavour is the different sources of water that reach the tap and the chlorine is used to clean it. The season and the amount of rain during the year will affect the mix. For example, winters waters will have a softer flavour than mid-August liquid.
A local -kind of- popular trick for people who mind the flavour is using a filtering jar like, for example, this one . Let’s be honest, Alicante has chalky and hard water. The filtering jar will soften the flavour a little bit and remove some of the mineral salts on it.
