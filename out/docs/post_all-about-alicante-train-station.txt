Train Station VS TRAM station in Alicante
Alicante has also a rail service called TRAM. It is a mix of a slow TRAM train for moving around the city and a slightly faster train for longer journies to places such as Villajoyosa, Benidorm, Altea or Denia.
The TRAM Station is 6 min walk from the Train Station in Alicante
So, for example, if you need to go to Madrid , Barcelona or Valencia you need to use a long-distance Renfe or -from June 2023- Iryo train. If you need to go to Benidorm, Altea, Villajoyosa or Denia you have to use one of the TRAM stations such as the one in Luceros. As a curiosity, Alicante-Benidorm by TRAM train takes about 1 hour and 10 minutes and costs 2,80€ single with no travel card.
All the information needed about the TRAM in Alicante, such as destinations, fares, schedule, travel cards and recommendations is in the article this sentence links.
Where to Buy Train Tickets From Alicante?
All the short, medium and long-distance trains from/to Alicante are operated by Renfe at the moment. Iryo is selling online low-cost tickets for high-speed and long-distance to Albacete and Madrid trains scheduled for June 2023 and onwards. Ouigo is selling tickets from the 1st of March 2023 and the service starts on May 2023.
There are a few ways to buy train tickets from or to Alicante :
You can buy tickets for Renfe’s trains in Alicante at Renfe’s Official Website . This is for trains going to all destinations available from Alicante.
At Renfe’s office inside the railway station in Alicante, a teller can assist you with the purchase in a more traditional manner. Only for long-distance trains to destinations such as Madrid or Barcelona.
The third way to buy train tickets to or from Alicante’s train station is by using the few automatic machines around the train station . This is for trains going to all destinations available from Alicante.

There are also third-party comparison websites , such as The Trainline , that offer Renfe train tickets in a similar way they compare prices for airlines.
How to Buy a Ticket from the Office Inside the Station
A funny contra intuitive situation is that buying a ticket in person is not so easy.
The Renfe’s office at the station has two different queues: one for trains that are leaving soon and another for the rest of the requests, including complaints and trains that are not immediately leaving.
Machine to get the number for the queue for trains leaving in the next few hours and complaints
To add more confusion, the queues for buying the tickets for trains that are leaving in a few hours/days need to get queue number from the small machine at one of the entrances. The same is true for complaints or other requests.
However, the queues for the trains that are leaving in the following minutes don’t have this electronic machine and you can just stand in line as you would wait for the teller at the bank or at the cashier in the supermarket.

Trains from Alicante to Elche
Alicante and Elche are two neighbourhood cities separated by just below 30km (18 mi).
There are two trains going to Elche from Alicante:
Cercanias Line C1
This is the most frequent, cheap and convenient train.
It takes between 30 and 31 minutes to go from Alicante to Elche and it stops in both Elche-Carrus and Elche-Parque .
The inconvenience of this line is the trains that are old. An early 80s diesel train (~40 years old!) that will make you enjoy if you are a train hobbyist but that smells a bit of diesel inside. Nevertheless, the trains have A/C and are well-maintained.
Note that you cannot buy online these train tickets! Cercanias does not appear on the main searcher on Renfe’s website. To buy the tickets you need to either go to Renfe’s office and ask the teller or find the Cercanias machine close to the train gates.

Long Distance Trains Alicante-Elche AV (Alta Velocidad)
In just 20 minutes, trains using the high-speed network from Alicante to Murcia have a stop at Elche Av (Alta Velocidad or High Speed) station.
The trains are electric, faster and newer but there are fewer trains per day plus the Elche AV train station is 7km (~4 mi) away from the city centre.
Elche AV to Elche City Center
You can buy online these tickets on Renfe’s website choosing as your destination “Elche AV”.
Other Services Alicante-Elche
It is possible to buy a ticket from Alicante to Elche Parque or Elcche Carrus through Renfe’s website.
Some services have a similar price as the C1 line and others will be more expensive.
Note the schedule you see from Renfe’s trains searcher is not the schedule for line C1. You will only see a very few services per day.
Also, note some services will take more time or be way more expensive than the C1 line. The only advantage is trains might be newer -so no diesel smell inside the carriages- but the C1 line might be more reliable, frequent and cheaper.
