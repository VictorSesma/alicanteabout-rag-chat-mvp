Alicante VS Benidorm
Alicante and Benidorm are two different cities situated in the same province. They are 40km away and are well connected by public transport: TRAM trains and coaches . Going from Alicante to Benidorm takes around 40 minutes by road but double the time by TRAM .
Location of Alicante and Benidorm
Alicante has been for thousands of years a bigger city than Benidorm. Benidorm has focused on the tourism industry in the last few decades while Alicante has been more of a Spanish-working city all this time. Nowadays Alicante has 337 482 ( 2020 ) inhabitants while Benidorm has 67 558 ( 2022 data ). In both cities, the population increases in summer but the Benidorm’s increment is of several sizes in its winter population due to tourism.
Both places have an old quarter, nice beaches and vivid nightlife but with a different vibe. While Alicante keeps the Spanish feeling all around the city, Benidorm is a mix of international cultures sensed in its shops, restaurants, hotels and party places. While British culture is strong in Benidorm it is far from being the only one represented around the town.
The weather is surprisingly good in both cities.

Old Quarter El Barrio
The main party area in Alicante with the most clubs. A bit of everything, from Latin music to techno not forgetting commercial Spanish music, commercial international music, reggaeton, rock and more. Clubs close at 3 am by law.
Castaños
Perfect for joining up on the Tardeo phenomenon. The Spanish usually start partying late. It is common to meet your friends for dinner at 10 pm and then go to a club from 11 pm-12 am up to 3 am or more moving to after-hours clubs.
In Castaños, people would meet earlier for a drink, from 5 pm or so, which is not that common in Spain. In that street, clubs open earlier than in the Old Quarter so you can be partying from 5-6 pm and go home earlier after a nice party evening.
Clubs will open in the evening and close at 3 am too.
Puerto
Puerto (means port or harbour) is in between El Postiguet Beach and Alicante’s marina, close by the “The Ocean Race” museum .
At Puerto , some of the clubs will close later than 3 am so it is a good place to go after a party at the Old Quarter or Castaños. There are different places with different music styles, including Latin music , and even a karaoke bar.

Playa de San Juan also has some pubs and clubs but the season when more people would party in this part of Alicante is summer.

Alicante FAQs
What is the Heat Like in Alicante during Summer?
Temperatures during summer can be a bit suffocating if you are not used to it. It is not common to have more than 35ºC during the day but possible. At night, it goes down to around 20ºC in the very early morning but most flats don’t have enough time to cool down. The Mediterranean Sea makes sure the humidity is high all day and night every day. Having A/C where you are staying is the safest bet if you don’t have experience with heat. Fans and dehumidifiers can help too. Keep in mind isolation in flats is not the best in older buildings.

Try visiting several real estate websites:
– idealista.com
The rental agreement usually requires the first and last month’s rent equivalent and the security deposit. If you found the flat using an agent then add one more month’s rent equivalent to the agent’s fee.
Is there an Hourly Rental car Company in Alicante?
It is very easy to rent a car in Alicante but, sadly, there is no service such as Zipcar.com, share-now.com or Hiyacar.co.uk where you can book a car from an app and drive it just for a few hours, without going to a rental company office first.
But car rental prices in Alicante are economical. A few example companies that would allow you to rent a car for a day with low fees are Centauro.net, wiberrentacar.com and drivalia.es.
A few years ago, a company called Mooving used the hourly/minutes rental system with an app for electric mopeds but went bankrupt during the 2020 pandemic after leaving Alicante a few months earlier.
