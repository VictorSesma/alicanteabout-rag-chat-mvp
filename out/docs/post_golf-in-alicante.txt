Are These Golf Courses for Me?
The areas where the courses are located is extremely different.
Alicante Golf is in an urban area in one of the most expensive neighbourhoods of Alicante city, Playa de San Juan ( San Juan Beach ). The course is rounded by buildings and it is near to pubs and the beach.
Next to the golf course, there is a party area with some pubs that might be open during the day but get busy at night, especially during the summer. This will appeal more to people staying in Alicante who wants the excitement of a lively city.
El Plantio , on the other hand, is far from the centre. It is very well connected by car as it is next to a road that joins Alicante and Elche. There are several redundant ways for the Alicante-Elche route so the traffic is not extremely intense. But noise is not an issue as the course and hotel are separated from the road.
There are no food shops nearby, being the closest one the supermarkets at Torrellano , a small rural neighbourhood of Alicante.
The airport is nearby but on the other side of the small hills. Planes’ noise might be possible to hear but only when the machines are at a high altitude and some flying and wind conditions are met.
This course is perfect for people who wants a calm place, far from the hustle and bustle of cities.
Bonus Course: Play Minigolf in Alicante for Free
