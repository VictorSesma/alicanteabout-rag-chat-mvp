Let’s start with some places to enjoy dancing salsa and bachata. Some clubs will mix several Latin styles into the same playlist but others will empathise one style over the others depending on the occasion or the particular vibe they have.
Alicante salsa dancing can be practised in any of these places as people are usually open and social. Some clubs might charge an entrance ticket at some times but they are usually free.
