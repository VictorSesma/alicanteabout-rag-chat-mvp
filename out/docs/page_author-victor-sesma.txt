Hello! This is Victor Sesma , the main author of alicanteabout.com .
I am an Alicantinian based in London but grew up and lived most of my life in Alicante.
I try to spend as much time as I can in the capital of Costa Blanca . Alicante is the city that has shaped me and my personality the most. Alicante is where most of my family and many friends are based.
In my mid-20s I worked as a waiter in Benidorm. This experience united with my life in the UK and London gives me a unique view of the city of Alicante and the province.

Why Writing About Alicante?
Being originally from Alicante but living in the UK has highlighted some opportunities to help people iron out some of the misconceptions about the city.
Alicante is so much more than just Benidorm and other touristy cities in the province a misconception that many tourists have-.
The combination of the city of Alicante and the province makes the city the perfect place to live and visit: good connections by plane, train and roads, great weather, fantastic food, incredible quality of life, great culture, friendly people… the list goes on.
This blog is trying to close the gap between some of the Alicante city misconceptions and the opportunities it offers to residents and visitors. I hope you enjoy it and get your questions answered by reading it!
My International Journey
I started opening to international people -rather than just Spaniards- when I was around 20 joining briefly the AEGEE students European organisation in uni.
Not much time later, I went to Norway for almost a year to work. Living outside my own culture was an incredible experience.
The decision to come to London happened after finishing a professional school degree and I have been living here since then.
As you can see, Alicante, London and other countries and cities have been part of my life and I try to help other people on their journeys to Alicante.
