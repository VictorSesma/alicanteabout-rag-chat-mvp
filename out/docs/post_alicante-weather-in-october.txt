The climate should be always taken into account when going on holidays or moving to a new city. October is the first full month of fall and, as everywhere else, the Alicante weather in October is different from what it is during summer. But how is it different?

Temperature
Usually, October is a very comfortable month thermally speaking. The summer is over and nights start to be chilled. The average minimum temperature gets down to 14.4°C (57.9°F) versus the 20.6°C (69.1°F) of August.
That means better sleep nights and no use of AC or fans. This is an important event in Alicante as nights can be sweltering in summer.
During the day, it can still get warm as the maximum average temperature gets up to 24.5°C (76.1°F). The day/night average temperature is 19.4°C (66.9°F) and you will usually be soaked by the sun when you are outdoors. In general, Alicante’s autumn and winter are warm.
Sea Temperature and Beaches
As you can see, that can easily be day-on-the-beach weather. But what about going into the water? Well, if you are a bit brave you can. The average Mediterranean seawater temperature is 22.4°C (72.32°F) during October.

To compare, in summer, the sea temperature on the central beach El Postiguet , can get up to 29°C (84.2°F) in summer but, during winter , it can go down all the way to 13°C (55.4°F). This means the sea is still warm in October in Alicante. Many people do enjoy the beach in October in Alicante.
As an example, here is a video from the Laboratorio de Meteorologia de la Universidad de Alicante , or Alicante University Meteorology Lab (On Facebook ). It dates from the 1st of October 2022:
Light Hours
In October, you will have 7 hours of sun irradiation and 11h of light. To put it in context, Oslo enjoys 1h hour less light per day than Alicante in October.
Rain Could Show Off
October is the month that historically rains the most in Alicante. Chances are still low but we need to understand that rain is different in other cities. In this part of Spain, it will rain a lot during a short period of time, 4.1 days on average. So when it rains it is usually cloudy for a few days but generally less than a week. The rain shows off intermittently but heavily during those days. When it starts raining the best is to be dry at home, a hotel or a shelter in a bar or restaurant. I wouldn’t say that this statistic is a deal-breaker and you probably should still organise your holidays for this month.
How to Enjoy Alicante in October
Alicante is a lively city all year round.
Alicante is a very Spanish city with lots of local people living all year round. Tourism goes down a bit in October compared to summer but there are always things to do, both culturally and partying style.
For example, you can visit some of the many museums in Alicante , visit Santa Barbara Castle , organise a sailing day off to Tabarca or join some Meet Ups happening in Alicante if you are a solo traveller wanting to meet more people.
