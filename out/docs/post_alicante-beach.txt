Beaches In Alicante:
Alicante city has more than +10 beaches but allows me to give you my recommendation.
If you are going to be a day or two in Alicante go to El Postiguet . It is in the centre of Alicante . If you stay central then you can just walk. If you are further away it is super well connected by public transport.
If you have time and want to go to a bigger and also very beautiful beach San Juan Beach is a must. It is well connected by public transport and it is big and beautiful.
If you are staying longer then you can enjoy visiting the different beaches and coves around the city.
In case you want to go to the beach with your pet there is a dog beach in Alicante . Also, all the beaches are open for dogs in winter, from the 1st of November to the 1st of March.
Here is the complete and ultimate list of beaches in Alicante:

During summer, water temperatures can reach up to 26.3°C (79.34°F) on average in August (it is common to find the waters even hotter). And in winter, it goes down to 14.1°C (57.38°F) on average so the minimum temperature of the water can be lower. This data is from weather-atlas.com .
It is safe to say that the beaches can be enjoyed anytime from May (19.1°C or 66.38°F) to October (22.4°C or 72.32°F). As the winter in Alicante can cool down the sea temperature a bit more going for a swim from November to April is only for the bravest.

El Postiguet Beach Alicante
El Postiguet Beach Alicante
El Postiguet is the most centrical beach in the city of Alicante. If you are staying near the city centre El Postiguet is just within a stone’s throw. It is a well-maintained beach protected on its sides by land so rough weather doesn’t affect this that much to this beach. It is 900m long so it is a medium-sized beach compared to other beaches in Alicante.
El Postiguet is one of the most crowded beaches in Alicante. All sorts of public find El Postiguet appealing as it is the most urban and central beach in Alicante. Usually, tourists and younger people tend to find a spot closer to the city centre and the Melia hotel. Older people and families tend to lie on the furthest half part of the beach. This is, of course, a very broad distinction.
The beach counts on Baywatch, first aid, local police, toilets, foot showers, volleyball net, chiringuito and other services… There is outdoor and indoor parking next to the beach that tends to get busy during peak season.
The views are quite picturesque. Playa de El Postiguet is one of the places where you can see The Moor Face on the Castillo de Santa Barbara hillside. The beach’s name comes from the language Valencian (a variant of Catalan) and means “little door”. The old walls protecting the city underneath the castle had an access door to the beach, hence the literal translation of Playa de El Postiguet would be The Beach of the Small Door .

San Juan Beach Alicante

San Juan Beach is the longest beach in Alicante and it is usually featured at the top of beach rankings in Spain . It merges with Muchavista beach in the neighbouring municipality of El Campello in an imperceptible imaginary line. San Juan is about 3km long but including Muchavista Beach it is almost about 7km long. San Juan Beach in Alicante is a golden sandy shore. The water can get bumpy sometimes as its shape is very open to the sea. There are views of the mountains in Alicante province and of other cities such as Benidorm.
Playa de San Juan has a couple of parking lots for the cars that get extremely busy in Summer. There are also several Tram stops from Luceros along the beach. Apart from lifeguard services, there is a sports area with volleyball nets, chiringuito , rental of aquatic material in summer, and restaurants next to the beach.

Playa de San Juan is a long and well-maintained sandy beach connected by Tram and Bus services. San Juan Beach has all the services you might expect from a high-quality beach in Alicante. There is a lot of space to accommodate lots of people due to its size.
The only downside is its exposure to the open sea. San Juan beach can be affected by rough weather more than other beaches in Alicante. During the hottest months, some mild wind will be present every day during the sun’s peak hours of the day. This is called terminal wind and is due to the temperature difference between the water and the land. Colder water provokes colder air. Hot land generates hotter air. Therefore, the wind will blow from the sea direction to land as the hotter air goes up into the atmosphere to be replaced by the colder sea air.
Thermal wind is fantastic for sailing and water sports. It usually doesn’t get too intense so the breeze is welcome during the hot summer temperature. The wind might create a few small wawes though. San Juan beach is not the absolute smoothest beach in Alicante but you should not get pulled off by this.
There is a promenade next to the beach with some restaurants, discos, pubs and shops.

Tabarca Island Beach Beach
Tabarca Beach In Alicante
Tabarca Island is the only inhabited island in the region. It is situated 22km from the centre of Alicante, counterintuitively, it is still part of the municipal term of Alicante city. The island of Tabarca is a magnificent place to visit. Ships have regular services to the islands from Santa Pola (shortest trip), Alicante and Benidorm (longest trip).
The island has one beach with all the services found on the rest of the city’s beaches: lifeguard, first aid foot showers, local police office… There are also several coves and places where you can go for a swim but are not being monitored by the lifeguards.
The island is small. Next to the beach at Isla de Tabarca , there are several places to have lunch or dinner. The traditional dish of Tabarca is Caldero . A fish-based dish. If you are looking for rice you can also ask in most of the restaurants. In Alicante, Paella is not a traditional rice dish and is only prepared for tourists. If you want to be sure of not falling into a tourist trap search for places announcing Arroz rather than Paella. It is a very similar dish made in the same pan but with a slightly different, and arguably better, style.
Tabarca’s beach has a heterogenic public that tends to be more adult and touristic. Many local people won’t get into the bout to Tabarca to go to the beach and, if they do, they might instead go to some of the beautiful coves rather than the beach itself. There are several clifts around the island that teenagers, (and no teenagers), use as trampolines to jump into the sea. Please, be aware this can be very dangerous and is not strange to read local news about someone getting seriously hurt by this practice every summer.
Tabarca is probably the best place on the Alicantinan coast to do snorkelling. Even better than Cabo de Las Huertas . Tabarca is a maritime reserve which means that fishing is forbidden and bouts have limited right to anchor depending on where Isla de Tabarca maritime reserve area they are situated. This measure allows flora such as Posidonia (Mediterranean endemic sea plant) and the different fish species to beautifully and picturesquely grow in the area.
The island has also public toilets next to the beach. In the same building complex, there is a museum that explains the centuries-long history of the island and the flora and fauna that can be found at Tabarca Island.
There are also some shops where to find typical beach products, such as icecreams, SPF cream and other beach items. Have in mind that the island can get ridiculously busy during peak season. It also can be extremely empty outside the tourist season. The same is happening with bouts anchoring around the beach.
Takeaways
What services does Tabarca Island Beach have? Full body showers, first aid and lifeguard, public toilets, sunbeds and umbrellas to rent, pedal boats… Note not all services will be always available.
Are there public toilets at Tabarca Island Beach? Yes. There are public toilets available that open following a schedule.

Cabo de Las Huertas Coves
Cabo de Las Huertas literal translation is Cape of the Orchards . Traditionally, the cape was used as land to grow food plants. Now, it is one of the most expensive and beautiful areas in the city of Alicante. El Cabo has a historic defence tower and a lighthouse for sailors in its inland area. The coast has several coves.
Cove at El Cabo de Las Huertas
El Cabo de las Hu ertas coves are probably the second-best place for snorkelling in the city of Alicante, after Tabarca island, so it might be the best place on Alicante’s mainland. There are several coves with different ease of access. For example, Cala de la Palmera , probably the most famous cove, has no regulated lifeguards and no tarmac parking space for cars to park. The access to the coves is rocky and hilly. Ironically, good hiking shoes are encouraged as you will need to pass through short but hiking-like paths.
Once you are at the cove, there are just a very few places with sand. It is recommended to also have aquatic shoes you can use for swimming as the accesses to the sea are sometimes through beaches or coves with rocks instead of sand.
It is a perfect place to explore different areas. If you head right while looking at the sea you will get closer to Alicante centre and the views of Santa Barbara Castle , El Postiguet beach and further places such as Tabarca Island or El Palmeral Park . The views are a sight for sore eyes. If you head left, you will get closer to San Juan beach but the cape shape doesn’t allow you to see San Juan beach until you are literally next to it.
Here is the list of recognised coves at El Cabo . Click to find the location on Google Maps: Cala de la Palmera , La Calita , Cala Cantalar , Cala de los Judios . Rember that a common strategy is to park at Cala de la Palmera and walk from there to the different coves.
Cala de la Palmera has a parking lot with no tarmac. Other coves might have parking spaces available also. The closest tram line 4 stop might be Cabo Huertas and the closest bus stop Camino del Faro 17 on Alicante bus services line 22 .

San Gabriel Beach
San Gabriel beach is a small local sandy beach in Alicante, next to the cargo port entrance. It doesn’t have most of the services that other beaches have. For example, there is no lifeguard, first aid services or foot showers.
San Gabriel Beach
This beach in the San Gabriel neighbourhood serves people living locally that want to get a quick bath and not spend much time commuting. Is not in such a privileged area as other beaches and the views are not so impressive yet you can see boats and ships coming in and out from the harbour. It has beautiful views of Tabarca island , Urbanova beach and south of Alicante’s province up to Santa Pola cape.
The beach is officially recognised by the city hall so it has litter bins, and wood access gateways and it is cleaned and maintained but just not daily as most of the other beaches in Alicante city.
As it is well known to everyone, the rivers for inland cities and the sea for coastal cities are the way out for sewer waters after they are cleaned in the treatment plants. Between the San Gabriel beach and the port of Alicante entrance, there is one of the pipes releasing treated water into the sea. This pipe has previously released untreated water due to technical issues or extreme weather conditions at the treatment plant.
Alicante’s city hall has recursively forbidden the bath in San Gabriel beach until neighbours would complain too much about the restriction to then allow the bath again and improve the cleaning services to forbid the bath once again . It is a polemic beach due to its closeness to the sewer pipe and how near is to the harbour. It has always been a fight between the neighbours who want to use it and the city hall that wants it completely unattended this beach.

Serragrosa Beach has bits of rocks but also sand
There are a few man-made coves in front of Serragrosa. It is a calm place with easy access by car as there are a lot of parking spaces that can get quite busy during peak season. It is a good and calm environment for families with children or local people who don’t want to commute.
Some of the coves will be sandy, some other coves will have stones or a mixture of both. Aquatic shoes are recommended for going into the sea. The water might be transparent in no deep shores and there are few places where is easier for children to enjoy as it won’t get deep too soon while you see the down water land.
The water might be a bit warmer than on other beaches as it is more protected from currents from the open sea and the water floor might receive more sun to warm up the waters.
