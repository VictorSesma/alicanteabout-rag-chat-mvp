Alicante TRAM – Prices, Timetables, Routes. All You Need to Know

URL: https://alicanteabout.com/transport/alicante-tram-prices-timetables-routes/

Alicante TRAM is a rail service that connects Alicante city centre with San Juan Beach and neighbouring towns such as El Campello, Benidorm and Denia.
Alicante-Luceros Tram Station
The TRAM service operates in underground tunnels in Alicante city centre and overground in the rest of the line. There are 6 TRAM lines split into 3 zones . Prices vary from 1.45€ single ticket for one zone to 3,90€ for single tickets for the 3 zones and the equivalent of 0,76€ to 1.90€ when using the most affordable travel cards . Night services are available on summer weekends at the same price. Frequencies vary per line.
Alicante’s TRAM service is reliable but can be slower than the car on some routes. The service inherits the old “Trenet” rails tracks and the updates from the old network focused on electrification and safety but not speed. Let’s see all you need to use this service, including pricing, routes and schedules.

How to Pay for The TRAM
Alicante’s TRAM has a mixture of fenced underground and unfenced overground stations.
At the underground stations, the tickets must be paid in advance on the machines around the stations and validated at the fence. A travel card is also valid.
TRAM Payments Machine
At overground stations, the payment must be done inside the TRAM train . This is a bit counterintuitive, as the stations don’t have any payment machines available. The payment is done inside the train. The travel cards are also validated on the train.
All payment machines allow for: card payment, cash payment, and travel card recharge.

The fares go down by more than 45% by paying with a travel card bonus. The same travel card pass can be used by more than one person on the same trip.
Temporary Discounts on Travel Card Bonus
From the 1st of February 2023 to the 31 of July 2024 there is a 50% discount on some of the travel cards.
This is due to a money injection in public transport the central government is undertaking through autonomics and local governments in order to keep the inflation rate lower.
The discounts are for the TRAM trains and MIA buses .
Note that the single trip fare remains at 1.45€.
The prices and fares for the travel card pass vary on the number of bought trips:
10 trips cost 4€ (normal price 8.00€) in between the same zone (0.40€ per trip, normal price 0.80€ per trip), 6€ (normal price 12,00€) in moving 2 zones (0.60€ per trip, normal price 1.20€ per trip) and 10€ per trip (normal price 20,00€) when moving 3 zones (1€ per trip, normal price 2€ per trip). A 24h for unlimited travelling in all zones is 8€.
TRAM Train Arriving at the Fabrequer station
30 trips cost 11.40€ (normal price 22.80€) (0.38€, normal price 0,76€ per trip), 17.10€ (normal price 34,20€) when moving 2 zones (0.57€, normal price 1,14€ per trip) and 3 zones commuting is 28.50€ (normal price 57,00€) (0.95€ per trip, normal price 1.90€ per trip).
Remember: The same bonus ticket can be used by several people on the same trip.
There is also a 24-hour ticket that can be used for as many trips and as many zones as wished during the activation day. It cost 4€ while bonified (8€ normal price).
The travel cards are different for each TRAM Zone and only allow trips in between the zone it is assigned to. As an example, if you have a 1 zone travel card but want to go from Alicante to Benidorm you will need to buy a ticket at the start of your journey in Alicante. Alternatively, a card can be recharged with trips valid for travelling in between zones.
Travel cards can be used only in the TRAM zone they have been habilitated for. Travel Card Mobilis bought for Tram Zone A can be used also in Alicante’s city buses .
Here is the fares summary table:

Free for Those Under 30
Another discount the government has kicked off is for those under 30 not to pay at all for the TRAM service in Alicante. The 100% discount is active from the 9th of October until the 30 of June 2024.
To qualify you just need to be under 30 years old and get a temporary carton travel card that will be attached to your Spanish ID card (DNI), your resident ID card (NIE) or your passport. To apply:
Enter Tram De Alicante website . Inside the Bulletin Board, press “ Free Jove season ticket – Request an appointment by clicking on this link >>> “. You should be redirected to this page.
Book an appointment to pick up your card in one of the TRAM De Alicante stations.
Pick up the travel card and validate it every time you use the bus or TRAM.
NOTE: If you don’t have a Spanish DNI or NIE follow the instructions in this link. Essentially, you need help from someone with a DNI or NIE to book the appointment for you. Then, at the time you have the appointment, borrow her/his ID card. Showing your friends’ ID and your passport you will be able to pick up your free travel card.
Even though the process to get the free travel card is done using the TRAM website and offices in the stations the discount is valid for the bus services too.
Also, remind you that, to qualify, you don’t need to be a resident, be empadronado or live in Alicante. Just be 30 or less and have a valid ID card/passport.
Special Zones T1 and T2
There are a couple of special zones called T1 and T2 that are situated where the TRAM zones switch. So T1 is in between Zone A and Zone B. T2 is between Zone B and Zone C. When travelling inside the special zones the tram ticket to pay is just for 1 zone.
As an example, a traveller from Calpe to Altea would typically have to pay for a two-zone ticket (C to A). But both TRAM stops are inside the special zone T2. That means travellers from Calpe to Altea would need to pay a ticket fare equivalent to just one TRAM zone.
Other Travel Cards Discounts
There are also travel cards for young and senior people. Talk to the staff at Luceros station about how to get it and to know if you qualify.
How to Buy a Travel Pass Card
To buy a Travel Card in Alicante city you can go to Luceros Station or any kiosk in Alicante as the same travel card works on Alicante’s busses and TRAM Zone A. At Lucreros, there is a counter with TRAM’s staff that will facilitate you with the proper travel card for your typical journeys and the first travel pass with 10 or 30 trips.
Mobilis Travel Card in Alicante for bus and TRAM
Once you have a travel card, it can be recharged on the machines at Luceros and Mercado or inside the TRAM trains. The card can be also used on the bus network at the same price.
Other gated stations in the TRAM network such as Benidorm or Campello also sell travel cards.
TRAM Zones and Travel Card Differences
Tram travel cards or bonuses can be used only in the TRAM zone they are assigned to. For example, if you bought a travel card in Alicante it can be used only in Tram zone A – Alicante Luceros to Poble Espanyol and other TRAM lines- and Alicante’s busses. If you bought the Mobilis travel card in Benidorm, it can be used only in zone B -from Amerador to Olla Altea in the north.
If you have a travel card bought in Alicante but want to travel to Benidorm you will need to buy a new ticket in the machine for the trip from zone A to zone B.
Alternatively, in the case you travel between Zone A and Zone B often, you can talk to a member of the staff at the counter in the tram-gated stations to assign the travel card to be valid for trips between two zones. This way you can use your travel card to travel from -as an example- Alicante to Benidorm.
Keep in mind, that if you assign two zones to your travel card every trip, even if it is inside one single zone, will be charged at the higher fee of two zones.
Equally, if you want to use your travel card for the special zones T1 or T2 you need a member of the staff to assign your travel bonus trips to be used only in the special zones.
How to use the Travel Cards Mobilis
1. The travel cards must be always tapped in at the start of your journey at either:
The gate at gatted TRAM stations -that are underground in Alicante and overground in the rest of the network-
Inside the TRAM train at the rest of the stations
It is important to always tap in as ticket inspectors randomly board the train.
2. The travel card must be only tapped out if you are getting off at a gated station . The automatic gate would check the trip has been previously validated and open the door for the traveller.
Several People Can Use the Same Travel Card
Note that the same travel card can be used by several people on the same journey. Just tap in the same travel card as many times as people are travelling.

In case of need to get off in a gated station just pass the travel card at the gate once per person travelling.
Be Aware of the Trips of your Travel Card Or Recharge Trips
To see the trips available or recharge your Mobilis TRAM bonus you can:
Ask a member of the staff at any station counter to do it for you
Use any ticket machine at stations or inside the TRAM trains
Use Alicante’s TRAM App for Android or for iPhones
Ask at kiosks in Alicante’s city for Zone A travel cards
Use the Same Travel Cards at Alicante Bus Service
Alicante TRAM travel cards for Zone A are valid for the bus service in Alicante . So, the travel cards bought in a kiosk or the TAM office can be used in the TRAM trains for zone A and vice-versa. The price per single trip and the travel card fees remain the same in both TRAMs and buses.
The official name for the TRAM trains is TRAM d’Alacant or TRAM de Alicante . Likewise, the name of the bus service is MIA, Movilidad Inteligente de Alicante , or Smart Mobility of Alicante.
Transfer between buses is free if done within 60 minutes from the first touch with the travel card. Sadly, transfers do not apply to TRAM services and changing from a TRAM train to a bus will just void another trip in your travel card.
Note that transfers with a single trip ticket are not available either in TRAMs or bus services.
The TRAM Trains
Most of the TRAM line is electric. The trains are modern and quiet. All trains have cooling A/C on in summer and heating in winter.
There are no toilets on the trains or stations, so have this in mind when planning a long trip.
The Inside of a TRAM Train
Note the TRAM has buttons inside the trains to ask the driver to stop at the next TRAM stop. This is especially important at slack times as any passenger might have pressed the stop button for the TRAM stop you would like to get off. It behaves in a similar way to what a bus would do.
Travelling With Bicycles, Scooters or Pets
Travelling with bicycles and scooters on the TRAM trains is permitted, even if your bicycle is not a folding bicycle.
If your bicycle is not folding you must stay standing while holding it.
If your bicycle or scooter is folding you must keep it folded and under your seat.
The TRAM services remind customers not to cause any damage to other passengers or the stations and trains with the vehicles.
Sadly, it is not permitted to travel with big pets such as dogs.
The exceptions are small pets in cages, recognised guide dogs and police dogs which are permitted.
