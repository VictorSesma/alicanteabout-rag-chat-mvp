How is La Albufereta Beach?
La Albufereta beach is a 400m long and 18m wide beach . It is inside a bay which makes it, usually, less prone to develop high waves under bad weather conditions.
Although the sea conditions can be better at this beach, there might be some steps and an uneven floor under the water. This is not a unique characteristic of La Albufereta but something to keep in mind.
On the north part of the beach (on the right-hand side looking to the water), there is a rocky area. If you keep walking for around 10 minutes you arrive at another beach, La Almadraba . In between those two beaches, there is a nautical club and a couple of rocky coves if you feel adventurous.
Have extreme precautions if you are going for a bath in any coves as they might not be lifeguarded and accessing/leaving the water might be dangerous.
On the south part of the beach, there are a few houses and a hotel a bit further on. There are several bathing areas along the walk but, again, they are not lifeguarded.
Sand at La Albufereta Beach
La Albufereta has good sand but is not on the absolute top. Other beaches such as San Juan or Urbanova overperform a bit. The sand is a bit thick as if they were more like tiny rocks that didn’t have the tame to become sand yet. It is usually well maintained and clean.
