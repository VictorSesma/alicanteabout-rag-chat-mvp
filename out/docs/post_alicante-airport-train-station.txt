Why Does Alicante Airport Have Not a Train Station?
Alicante Airport hit the 15 million passengers per year milestone in December 2019. The European Union recommends train station connections to airports with more than 6 million passengers (in Spanish) . Nevertheless, Alicante Airport has no train station.
It has been repeated through the years by Spanish politicians that the station will be done. The 2008 crisis delayed for years the project. Local, regional and national politics haven’t helped either as no government has taken the project seriously.
Another reason the train station project has been blocked is that there is a medium-distance train going to Murcia whose tracks pass 1.5 mi (2.5km) away from the terminal. That train line is expected to be moved away from where it is now, right next to the sea for several miles. This project being stuck -as well- was delayed even more by the Alicante Airport’s train.
