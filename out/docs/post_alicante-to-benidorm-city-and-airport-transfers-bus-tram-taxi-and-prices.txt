Alicante Airport to Benidorm
When travelling from Alicante airport to Benidorm the public transport TRAM option is more difficult to use as you will need to travel to Alicante city centre first.
Even with this inconvenience, there are some other ways to go from Alicante to Benidorm. The best one will depend on your budget and time.
Planes at Alicante Airport
Despite the lack of a train station in Alicante airport , there is a coach/bus station as well as taxis, private taxi transfer companies, car rental companies at the airport and a pick-up/drop-off zone for private cars at Alicante airport.
Let’s go to see all your options for going to Benidorm from Alicante Airport.
Alicante Airport to Benidorm By Bus+TRAM Train
There is no train station at Alicante Airport. So to get the TRAM train from Alicante to Benidorm you need to commute first from Alicante Airport to Luceros TRAM Station.
The cheapest way to travel from the airport to Alicante TRAM train station in Luceros is by bus line C6. It costs 3.85€ you can pay by card or cash. It takes about 25-30 min to reach the TRAM station and there is a bus every 20 min approx.
The first bus stop with a connection to the TRAM is Vazquez de Mella . But, two stops later, at Plaza de Los Luceros, 17 , is the Luceros TRAM station. If you are not familiar with the TRAM de Alicante service it might be wise to wait and take off the bus at Luceros station.

The total cost of going from Alicante airport to Benidorm by bus plus TRAM is 6.65€ .
As you probably know, the price is calculated by adding the price of the bus line C6 from Alicante Airport to Alicante city centre -3.85€- to the price of the TRAM from Alicante to Benidorm -to travel two zones costs 2,80€-.
The travelling time using the bus + TRAM to go from Alicante to Benidorm is 1h and 40m. But the total trip time will be longer as you need to add the time to wait for the C6 bus (up to 20 min) and allow time to enter the Tram station, pay for the ticket and get the next train to Benidorm (up to 30 min wait).
The recommendation would be, if you decide to use this commute Bus+TRAM allow, at least, 2h30m to complete the journey from Alicante to Benidorm.
A way to make the journey a bit quicker without going to the roof on the budget is to use a taxi to the TRAM train station and then take the TRAM service. This option is a bit more expensive but less than using a taxi all the way to Benidorm.
