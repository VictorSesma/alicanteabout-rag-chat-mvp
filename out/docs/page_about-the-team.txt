About the Team

URL: https://alicanteabout.com/about-the-team/

AlicanteAbout.com is managed by the company CLUSTER SOLAR LTD.
We thrive on having you here and hope this website helps you navigate around Alicante and everything it has to offer.
At CLUSTER SOLAR LTD we work hard so you receive the most accurate and updated information about transport, activities, monuments and life in Alicante.
This project is an ongoing website but the team is small, Victor Sesma is at moment part-time working on it.
You can expect little but constant updates: sometimes new content, sometimes a link to the website code to make it faster or better good looking. Sometimes it is an update on current content so it is always updated and keeps accuracy with the ongoing changes in Alicante.
To get in touch with the team check the contact page.
Hope you have a good journey in Alicante.
