Santa Faz Pilgrimage
Each year after Easter , thousands of Alicantinians walk from Alicante San Nicolas Concathidral to Santa Faz monastery .
In 2024, the Santa Faz Pilgrimage is on Thursday 11th of April. It is a bank holiday for Adults and Children at schools.
The walk starts early in the morning with the political and Catholic authorities that stop at each of the Stations of the Cross set along the way. A float is also carried.

For most people, Santa Faz peregrination is just a tradition and not a religious expression, similar to what happens with easter .
At the start of San Nicolas Concathidral, the city hall awards the early birds with a bamboo stick with rosemary. The stick can be used as a walking stick that would make the way easier for the less fit people.
On the way, it is traditional to make a short stop and enjoy rosquillas (in Spanish) , anis and mistela .

There is also music and little marking present that some companies will award with to the peregrines.

The History of Santa Faz
The origin, story, legends and traditions of Santa Faz are fascinating. It is a festivity with more than 500 years of story and 250k people walking every year.
The Christian tradition says Alicante has one of the 3 Holy Visages -also called the Veil of Veronica – recognised by the Holy See .
The Holy Visage is a Christian relic consisting of a piece of cloth with an image of the Holy Face of Jesus imprinted. It was taken by Saint Veronica during the Passion of Jesus -the events happening near his death-.
There are 3 copies and one of them ended up in Alicante in 1489 when the veil was given in Rome to a Spanish priest .
