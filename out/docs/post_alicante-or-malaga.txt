It has managed to grow its character into nearby and beautiful areas. Two examples are the promenade “ La Explanada” or the harbour. All at a very short distance from each other. Instead, Malaga has a beautiful old town but it is sided by less special modern city block buildings.

For example, the famous regional dish in Alicante is Paella but the people of Alicante don’t prepare paella , they cook Arroz . An arguably better version of paella .
The same is true in Malaga. Local people from Malaga don’t prepare Gazpacho Andaluz, they prepare Porra Antequerana . It is, again, similar to the main commercial gazpacho but an arguably better version.
Even dishes that are widely famous in Spain, such as Tortilla de Patatas , have differences in their preparation depending on the region.
