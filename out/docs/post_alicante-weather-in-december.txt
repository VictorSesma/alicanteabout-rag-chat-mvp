People on el Postiguet Beach in December
The beaches are open all year round and, on the sunnier and warmer days, people enjoy Alicante’s beaches such as El Postiguet or San Juan .
I wouldn’t say you can swim in Alicante in December. It might be just warm enough for a quick swim but not for staying in the water for a long time without a wet suit. In fact, 16°C inside the water feels way cooler than just outdoors as your body loses heat much faster in water.
Rain in December in Alicante
The average of precipitations is low in Alicante in December. We have left behind September, October and November which are the three wetter months of the year. The average of rainy days in December is 3.7 days.
In the city of Alicante, it never snows. To be accurate, no one remembers it. There are some images of snow in 1932 . That year was the last time it snowed and settled for a few hours. Never again since then.
If you want to find snow you can drive a few kilometres up in the mountain. Almost every year the snow will settle there for a couple of days or so, depending on the year.
As you can see, December might not be a month for going to the beach but is warmer than in many other cities in Spain and Europe. It is perfect for escaping the cold and dark winter.
What To Wear
What clothes to wear to a trip is always challenging. In December, Alicante is cold at night but warm at daytime.
Wear a mix of T-shirts and trousers for the mornings (approx 15°C to 20°C) and jumpers/coats/jackets for nights and early mornings (approx 3°C-5°C).
If you are brave and it is not windy, you might feel comfortable for a few hours on warmer days under the sun in shorts and T-shirts, or even on the beach in your swimming clothes.

New Year’s Eve in Alicante
In Spain, New Year’s Eve or Nochevieja is celebrated with 12 grapes and most cities won’t have a fireworks show.
The grapes are eaten on each of the bell strikes traditional clocks make indicating the hour. At midnight the clocks make 12 bell strikes and people eat one grape at each bell toll. It is a fun ritual followed all across Spain.
People usually gather either around the TV while following live streaming, usually being recorded from Puerta del Sol in Madrid or at squares in their localities.
In the 2023 to 2024 New Year’s Eve, Alicante will host two parties, one for families with children in the morning and one for adults at night.
