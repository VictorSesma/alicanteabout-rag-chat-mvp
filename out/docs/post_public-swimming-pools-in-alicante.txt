The public transport links are not the best. The only line that will leave you very near to the Monte Tossal swimming pool is line 39 . Another good option is line 05 which will drop you out ~8 minutes away on foot.

What Can You Do in the Public Swimming Pools?
The swimming pools in Alicante offer courses designed for children, adults/teenagers and retired people. You can choose to go there and swim free by yourself or join one of the classes. If finally, you decide to join a course, the only restriction is that you have to join in advance for a full quarter. Let’s go to see how it works.
Swimming Freestyle by Yourself
This is the easiest way to go to the pool. You just need to show up with a kind of ID: driving license, passport, NIE… and pay the entrance fee. There is a possibility to buy several entrances at the same time to save some money. A bit more information in this article.
Joining a Class for a Quarter
During the year, they do several courses targeting different people. The public can be children learning to swim, adults improving their swimming abilities or retired people keeping their bodies in shape by doing water aerobics . An important note to this is that you must be on the census in Alicante to be able to subscribe to these services. Here is all the information (in Spanish).
Public Swimming Pools Prices in Alicante
The prices are a bit difficult to find and you will need to have a good level of Spanish. They are inside a .pdf file on this page. If you registered on the census you might be able to get a 50% discount if you are younger than 26 or older than 63. Other scenarios where you will get a discount are: having a disability, being referred by a doctor and a few more. You will need to read the document or ask in the comments below to know more.
