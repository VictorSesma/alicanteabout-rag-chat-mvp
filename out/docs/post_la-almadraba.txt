The Beach
La Albufereta is 750 meters long or half a mile-long beach. It has a mixture of sandy zones and rocky-cove-style areas on the right when looking at the sea.
To the left, another rocky-cove area begins: El Cabo de Las Huertas . To the right, La Albufereta beach is further away after the nautic club Costa Blanca (in Spanish) .
This beach is extremely family-friendly. It is not strange to find families and groups of friends with events sheltered having some food and drinks.

The beach itself is good for these social activities as right behind the sand, there are large three areas that swimmers won’t use with their towels. There are also open areas to the left of the beach that are not suitable for sunbathing but they are for a day out with friends and family.
This beach wouldn’t be on my top list if you are visiting Alicante just for a few days. Nevertheless, if you live in the area, then it is worth checking out. It is a cute beach. More info on this article listing all the beaches in Alicante city and raking them .
La Almadraba is a good beach to spend some time at the sunset. Even though there is no direct view of the sun hiding on the horizon the colours are still beautiful to see. There are palm trees around the beach and views of Santa Barbara castle from far away, right in the zone where the sun will disappear from your view. The vibe on the sunsets is calm and relaxed.
During summer they mount a chiringuito to have cocktails and a few tapas are available.
The Sand
The sand at La Almadraba is very clean. But it is black coloured and gets compacted easily after a few people steep on it.

Flags Colours Code for Swiming Security
All beaches with lifeguards have a flag colour code that everyone should know and observe:
Green flag: It is safe and permitted to go for a swim
Yellow flag: Getting into the water is permitted with limitations. You should always be able to touch the ground when standing.
Red flag: it is forbidden to get into the water
Note that it is not always obvious it is dangerous to go for a swim. For example, there might be jellyfish in the beach area that is not observable at first sight.

Cycling to La Almadraba Beach
If you are a bike fan I have bad news for you. There is not an easy connection to La Almadraba Beach for cyclists.
The roads don’t have cycling lines and there are sections where cars go kind of fast. Cycling on the round is permitted if you are brave enough.
Car to La Almadraba
The beach La Almadraba has a car park with more spaces than other beaches. At the same time is one of the beaches worst connected by public transport, probably as bad as the beach in Urbanova .
The difference is that La Almadraba has little car parking compared to Urbanova but La Almadraba is less popular.
The final result is that there will be queues for parking if you go to the beach during summer and peak hours but there are more chances to park next to the beach than in El Postiguet or in San Juan but it will take more time than in Urbanova (click on the beaches names if you want to know more about them).
Who is La Almadraba for?
The beach is for people who value more cosiness and calm water rather than sand quality. At the same time is good if you want to have some extra space in the wider area for parasols or small beach settlers.
La Almadraba after days of heavy rains
Some parts of the bath areas might get underwater mud so you should be okay with that also if you go to La Almadraba.
The public on this beach is usually families that tend to spend hours in the area. Sometimes you can find them having food or drinks together when is not peak season.
Nevertheless, is a good beach to try if you are staying in Alicante for longer periods but not if you are a few days tourist as there are other better beaches to visit in Alicante. This article has a list of all of them.
