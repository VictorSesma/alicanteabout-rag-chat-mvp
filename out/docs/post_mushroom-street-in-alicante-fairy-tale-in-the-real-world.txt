Where is the Mushroom Street?
The Mushroom Street is located in Calle San Francisco, 03001, Alicante, Spain .
The location is very central. To the West, it starts from the enigmatic park of Calvo Sotelo . Close to the shopping mall El Corte Ingles and 10 min away from the TRAM Stop in Plaza de los Luceros .
On the East, it ends in Portal de Elche , another enigmatic little parc with centenary trees.
Mushroom Street doesn’t last for the whole of San Francisco Street but the vibe of a walkable street with shops and restaurants is alive all along.
Why was the Mushroom Street Created?
Mushroom Street is the answer of 2013 Alicante’s city hall to two main issues:
A long financial crisis that started in 2008 and was still ongoing in 2013
A plan to revitalise an area of Alicante’s city that had a lot of insecurity and immigration
In 2013, the creation of Musshroms Street helped to change the vibe of the whole area from being a dirty and insecure zone to the current vibrant and cosmopolitan vibe this pretty part of the city currently has.
The creation of Mushroom Street was the culmination of a series of actions focused on improving the area’s vibe. For example, in 2001, 20 shops were closed by the city hall due to irregularities ( source in Spanish ).

Nowadays, there are dozens of prosperous businesses such as restaurants and shops. The improvement of the economy in the area was the second objective of 2013 City Hall.
The mushroom designs were done by Sergio Martinez , an artist who also creates Hogueras for the Bonfires Festival in Alicante .
In 2013, taxpayers were looking very closely at every Euro of public spending due to recent corruption cases among the political class and the bad economic situation. The cost of Mushroom Street was €66000 and created a huge polemic discussing if the spending was sensible in the middle of the crisis with high numbers of unemployment.
