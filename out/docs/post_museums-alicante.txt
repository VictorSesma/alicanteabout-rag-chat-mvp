Exploring Alicante’s Museums: A Journey Through History & Art

URL: https://alicanteabout.com/things-to-do/museums-alicante/

Alicante ‘s museums are a mix of millennial archaeology, modern art and the city’s people’s culture. Alicante is a very old human settlement. The first records of human activity date from the Bronze Age, starting 5000 years ago. Part of this heritage is stored in its museums or at archaeological sites. But there is a lot more.
Museum at Tabarca Island
The city of Alicante has plenty of museums with paintings, sculptures, historical items and general culture. There are also old ruins and other heritage to visit. Some of this legacy is thousands of years old, such items stored in the MARQ museum. Many other ruins have centuries of history, such as Santa Barbara Castle . Other museums tell the story of the Ocean Race regatta or Tabarca Island , to name two examples. There is plenty to choose from, options for adults and children.
Another important event that left a lot of legacy in the city was the Spanish Civil War. As you can see there are many things to do in Alicante. The war ended in Alicante, on the 1st of April in 1939. Old buildings such as the air-raid shelters shaped Alicante and many other cities in Spain.

MARQ Museum Alicante
Museo Arequeologico Provincial de Alicante or Provincial Archaelogical Museum of Alicante. This is probably the most important museum in the city and province of Alicante. There is an article with a complete explanation of the MARQ museum in this article .
Marq Museum Entrance at Christmas
The MARQ is an interactive museum. It has an array of permanent and temporary expositions. In the permanent rooms, there are assets from around 10000 years ago, that’s the prehistory era. Each big room covers one historical period: prehistory, Iberians, Romans, Middle Ages and contemporary culture.
They also have temporary expositions running. On the MARQs website , there is a list of expositions they have at each point in time. The page is not very well translated into English but all the museum explanations are written in several languages, including English.
Visit MARQ’s Basement or Archeological Sites
Another experience MARQ Museum offers is a visit to archaeological sites and, even if it sounds weird, their basements.
On the visit to the basements, you can learn more about how the back office of the museum works. They will explain how they do the storage, restorations, sending/receiving of valuable items and more. The visit is guided and 1h long.
If you feel more adventurous they have visits to the actual archaeological sites where some of the items in the showrooms were found. In Alicante and Alicante province, there are several iconic archaeological sites such as Illeta dels Banyets. This small peninsula was detached from the mainland in an earthquake many years ago. But, in 1943, it was attached again to mainland Alicante and now it can be visited on foot. It is situated in the town of Campello and can be reached with TRAM line 1 , stop Poble Espanyol .
This is not the only site to visit but arguably the most picturesque. There are more on their archaeological sites page .

Aguas de Alicante and Garrigós Wells
Aguas de Alicante (Alicante’s water) is the company serving potable tap water in Alicante . One of the social compromises the company has is maintaining the museum.
There are 3 showrooms explaining the water history at the museum.
The ground floor shows the history of water in Alicante through the time and cultures that inhabited the area.
The first floor has educational and interactive games using tablets and experimental machines to show the water cycle and how it ends up at home. This area of the museum is perfect for children who will be able to touch and understand experiments with the water.
And, lastly, the second floor shows the main projects that have been completed lately to enhance the efficiency of the waters network in Alicante and other actions taken to improve efficiency.
It is important to point out that the museum does not have a translation into English for the texts on the exposition walls. Still worth visiting.

Visit a Cententenary Well (Garrigós Wells)
Alicante’s inhabitants had to be very creative when it comes to water. The city is in a semi-arid area so rain is not constant or abundant.
Luckily the mountains nearby provided some rivers and sort of constant sources of water that have been used in more recent times. During the XVI century, the excavation of the rock of Mount Benacantil for creating water wells started. On the XIX, the current Garrigós wells were built. The facilities went out of use in 1898.
These old man-made wells excavated on Santa Barbara ‘s castle mountain can be visited now. The entrance to the wells is inside the museum Aguas de Alicante itself. The environment is a bit cold and humid. It feels like the indoors of a cave.
Who is Aguas de Alicante Museum for?
Adults and children can enjoy and learn about water in this museum. Plus the Garrigós wells are an important heritage in the city.
How much is the entrance to Aguas de Alicante Museum?
The museum entrance is free, including Garrigós Wells.

Museo De La Ciudad de Alciante (MUSA)
Museo de la ciudad de Alicante or Alicante’s City Museum explain the history of the city of Alicante. It has archaeological remains, and audiovisual content to explain the history and historical building remains.
MUSA is spread into different showrooms at Santa Barbara Castle . The showrooms are:

Salas de la Mina o Cuevas de Los Ingleses (Mine’s Rooms or The English Caves): Tells the story of the War of the Spanish Succession and how it affected the castle and the city.
The expositions might not be the most appealing to children but are not big showrooms and most have interactive videos. Also, Santa Barbara Castle is a must-see in Alicante that children will love as it is mainly an outdoor activity that implies exploring. In addition to this, there is always the intent of making the castle appealing to children with activities or little surprises children would love around the castle.

Alicante Air Raid Shelters
The history of war also affected Alicante. The Second World War took the shape of a Civil War in Spain where two bands, the Republicans and the Nationalists, fought each other.
Alicante’s people and infrastructure were not an exception and suffered brutal and devasting consequences in this war. Alicante’s port was the last place in Spain taken by the nationalists .
Ashamedly, until that happened, Alicante was bombed several times. The, arguably, most dramatic plane bombing in Spain during the war had as the main target Mercado Central. The date was Wednesday, 25 May 1938. It happened during a busy day and I prefer not to write here about the consequences it had. Check the Wikipedia article if you want to know more.
In order to protect the people, shelters with a capacity of around 30000 people were built. Some of them are open to guided visits nowadays.
Visit an Underground Air Raid Shettler
At the moment, there are 2 Air Raid Settlers open in Alicante under guided visits:
One on Seneca Square:
And one on Balmis Square:
The tours are offered by Turiguias Alicante . On their website, they have links to book the tours in English or Spanish. An adult ticket is 5€, and children under 6 years old have free entrance. Tickets for youngsters up to 18 years old, retired people and other bonified sectors are 3€.
The schedule varies every week so it is better to check their website.
Check Out More Memories From the Civil War
Furthermore, the city of Alicante has many other remains of the civil war. An enthralling history is about the British cargo ship Stanbrook (in Spanish) , captained by Archibald Dickson. It happened to be in Alicante to load some saffron, oranges and tobacco when the war was about to end.
Statue honouring Stanbrook’s Captain Archibald Dickson
Even though the cargo had arrived in Alicante’s port after a few days of waiting, Dickson decided to leave the cargo and rescue all the Spanish refugees who were waiting at the port. 10 minutes after the ship had left, Alicante suffered another bomb attack.
It was 27 March 1939.
A total of 1832 people got into Standbrook. After 20 hours of travel, they arrived in Oran, situated in the French part of Argelia at the time.
There were a few more days and weeks until everyone was able to disembark. The story of the refugees in Oran is motley. Some ended up at internment camps in Argelia but also many had good opportunities in other countries.
Archibald Dickson was originally from Cardiff, Wales. There is a commemorative statue at Alicante’s port with a plaque. Alicante’s city donated the same plaque to Cardiff a few years ago.
After a few years exposed to the public, it was about to change location to the Pierhead building in Cardiff but the plans have been delayed by the COVID pandemic.
Who are the Air Raid Shelters for?
Adults who want to know more about WWII and Civil War history. Children will enjoy exploring subterranean tunnels.
How much is the entrance ticket to the Air Raid Shelters?
Free for children younger than 6. 3€ up to 18, retired people and vulnerable sectors. 5€ adult ticket. Buy your ticket at Turiguias.com
Are the Air Raid Shelters open?
Yes, check Turiguias’ website as the visit times change continuously.
Are there guided tours to the Air Raid Shelters?
Yes, the visit to the Shelters is possible only through guided tours.
Hogueras De San Juan Museum in Alicante
Alicante celebrates Hogueras de San Juan (San Juan Bonfires) every year from the 20th to the 24th of June. And then, there are also fireworks every night from the 25th up to the 29th of June.
Ninots at Hogueras Museum Alicante
Most Spanish cities have a festivity celebrated yearly. Virtually always, the city hall involucres in its organisation. Many city halls in Spain have a party councillor with a budget of public money assigned.
Many private citizens and popular associations also get involved and spend their own money on the celebrations. Some townspeople would get loans to celebrate the festivity, especially if there is a rotating position in the party’s organization.
As said earlier, Alicante’s main festivity is Hogueras de San Juan and the city hall and people involvement are massive.
Other examples of city-held festivities are the Seville Fair (Feria de Abril), Los San Fermines in Pamplona and La Tomatina in Bunol to name a few examples. Alicante’s festivity is Las Hoguera de San Juan . 4 days of full parties where the streets become museums filled with gigantic sculptural bonfires. The streets become party clubs and the Spanish love for outdoor living and noise becomes obvious.
Alicantinians have the concept of “Mascletas”. It is held every day at 2 pm in Luceros during Hogueras . It is a fireworks show… except for the fact that there are no fireworks to see as the point is to hear the noise. Massive crakers are exploited on land and air in a symphony of pure crakers’ noise.
Massive bonfires are built and burned every year. The main structure can be as high as a 4-floor building but there are also smaller de-attached sculptures called Ninots . These are usually no higher than 2 m high. Every year, one of these small Ninots is “saved” from being burnt and given the status of “ Ninot indultado ” or pardoned Ninot in English.
Example of Hoguera during the Bonfires Festival in June. Examples of Ninots (the statues)
This happens after a jury visits every bonfire around the city and decides on the most beautiful or significant Ninot sculpture to pardon. Las Hogueras de San Juan is a kind of complex festivity and neighbourhoods compete with each other on the best bonfire, Ninot, party organisation and many other categories.
The Ninots are stored in Las Hogueras de San Juan Museum . There are other elements to visit at the museum: traditional costumes, clips and information about the bonfire festival …

Organise a Trip to Alicante on Hogueras de San Juan
If you have never been to any Spanish festivity, San Juan Bonfires might be like something you have never experienced before.
Huge artistic sculptures, noise, people partying on the street, art, satire… there is so much stuff to experience.
The best advice is to book your trip to Alicante from the 20th to the 24th of June. But be sure you can party on the 24th as the La bañá happens on that night.
Last night, when the main festivity ends, the bonfires are burned. A mix of crackers, gasoline and inflammable products designed for bonfires help set the sculpture on fire. Firefighters are in charge of keeping the bonfire burned safely.
The bonfires are burnt in the middle of the city, many times quite close to residential buildings. Safe perimeters and the firefighters’ presence ready to take action are foremost for security. La bañá or the bath in English is the act of the firefighters throwing anti-fire water at the spectators.
Children, teenagers, and young and senior people get soaked every year during the bañá . Remember that June is already summer and hot at night in Alicante, it is a night to enjoy the tradition.
