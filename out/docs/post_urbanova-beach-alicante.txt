Not all the length of this beach is Urbanova. The beach is part of Alicante and part of Elche. It has different names depending on the exact location and it has different uses such as dog beach and naturist beach.
The Different Names on Urbanova Beach
Agua Amarga: The Dog’s Beach
At the south of Alicante centre and right to the north of Urbanova, there is a beach called Agua Amarga (literally Bitter Water). Since 2016 has been the dog’s beach in Alicante. It features some dog’s special settings such as specific bins for the dog’s droppings or a fenced area that pets can use as a toilet. Here is the link to the Goole Maps beach location .
Playa de Los Saladares: The Naturist Beach
Right at the end of Urbanova’s promenade , there is the beginning of the naturist beach. Here is the location in Google Maps. It is between Urbanova Beach (Alicante) and El Altet Beach (Elche). The change is negligible and you will never know the exact point where the beach changes names.
As you already know, the dress code on this beach is naked and some people will be offended by seeing people staying in swimming clothes.
This part of the beach is extremely beautiful as it is part of a natural reserve with natural sand dunes.
El Altet Beach: The Begining of Elche
Elche is Alicante’s neighbour town and municipality. The part of the beach called El Altet depends on Elche’s city hall and administration and money. The beach has Lifeguards and other essential services.
Getting to this part of the beach is a bit more complicated as there are no direct public services from Alicante.
Urbanova is Near By the Airport
The beach is very close to the airport. The landing track is pointing straight to Urbanova. The planes will pass a bit near the beach. Some days, depending on where is the wind coming from, it is possible to listen to the planes landing or taking off from the beach.
Understanding the Beach Flags Codes
Urbanova has the Blue Flag award. The criteria for obtaining the flag are water quality, environmental information, safety features and services. This ensures that the beach is safe and enjoyable. The flag can be seen from the beach.
As well there are other flags raised by the Lifeguards that are very important to understand and follow. They have 3 colours that will be repeated along the beach:
Green flag : Getting into the water is permitted and safe . Be always cautious.
Yellow flag : Getting into the water is permitted with limitations . You should always be able to touch the ground when standing.
Red flag : Getting into the water is not permitted .
The reasons why the lifeguards will raise one or another flag are variated. The weather conditions, the presence of jellyfish or other animals or the water quality are examples. It is extremely important to follow the flags as not doing so can be life-threatening and punishable.
Who is Urvanoba Beach for?
The beach is semi-urban, not so well connected by public transport and in a calm area. There are no party pubs nearby but it is easy to find food restaurants.
On this beach, there will be a bit fewer people than on other beaches such as El Postiguet or San Juan . As it is more difficult to get there there will be fewer groups of teenagers or very young people. The beach atmosphere is calmer and many families choose it because of that.
